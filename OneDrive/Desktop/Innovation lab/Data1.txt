he Lake Waikaremoana Track is one of three Great Walks in New Zealand’s North Island. These Great Walks are hiking tracks, deemed to showcase some of the best natural landscapes in the country, with the trails and accommodation maintained to a far higher standard than your typical backcountry hut.

Lake Waikaremoana is one of the lesser-walked tracks, especially in comparison to the big hitters down in the South Island, which get booked out months in advance. And sure, Lake Waikaremoana doesn’t have those snow-capped mountains and pristine golden-sand beaches, but its scenery is impressive nonetheless. And the lack of crowds allow you to truly disconnect and immerse yourself in this spiritual destination.

I loved walking the Lake Waikaremoana Track and highly recommend it as a multi-day adventure in New Zealand. Today, I’m going to be sharing absolutely everything you need to know about preparing for and tackling this fantastic walk.
