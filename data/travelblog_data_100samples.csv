Back in 2012, Dave and I and a bunch of his friends chartered a yacht for two weeks in Turkey, and it was one of my least enjoyable experiences ever.;;;;;;;;;
Oh god, the seasickness.;;;;;;;;;
I felt nauseated for two weeks straight (while battling an inner ear disorder that had left me with vertigo, because of course). None of the motion sickness tablets I tried worked on my stomach, and we’d had several paramedics with hefty first aid kits on board. Oh, and whenever I resorted to pills, I ended up sleeping my days away.;;;;;;;;;
I was the only person on the yacht who had zero sailing experience, so I had no idea what was going on most of the time. Everything seemed terrifying and out of my control. I didn’t know what any of the ropes did, or what a jib was, or how to tie knots, or to look out for cleats.;;;;;;;;;
The ocean was cold; the food and mooring fees were overpriced; there weren’t any beaches.;;;;;;;
Rather than island hopping from secluded bay to deserted cove, we instead spent our time raging against the rough waters that ran along the jagged coastline.;;;;;;;;;
There was no real wind either, so we didn’t even get to actually sail.;;;;;;;;;
“Oh god, stop dancing and get me off this boat, Dave.”;;;;;;;;;
And throughout that trip, everyone on the yacht couldn’t stop talking about how Turkey had nothing on Greece.;;;;;;;;;
In Greece, I was repeatedly told, the ocean was as calm as a swimming pool. The water was warm. You didn’t get ripped off by taverna owners. The food was inexpensive and delicious. There were beaches and bays and it was so much prettier.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I bought what they were selling, so when Dave invited me aboard a 47ft yacht in Greece earlier this year, I leapt at the chance.;;;;;;;;;
It was only when our departure date loomed closer that I thought about backing out.;;;;;;;;;
Because, well, how had I managed to forget I get seasick in swimming pools?;;;;;;;;;
I was practically guaranteed to spend my week in the Ionian feeding the fishes my feta cheese lunches.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So what made me get on the boat despite my fears?;;;;;;;;;
Well, if there’s one thing that travel has taught me over the past five years, it’s that you’re not growing as a person unless you’re at least on the outskirts of your comfort zone. And with my anxiety no longer wreaking havoc on my life, thanks to a change in diet, I could now turn my attention to all the other work I wanted to do on myself.;;;;;;;;;
I saw sailing in Greece as an opportunity to challenge myself, to make myself proud, to pick up a new skill, or maybe even to prove that I can still have fun while feeling terrible. I’m far stronger than I was in 2012. And plus: we were there for Dave’s birthday. I’d have felt like a terrible girlfriend if I’d skipped out on those celebrations.;;;;;;;;;
After receiving confirmation that if I felt truly seasick, I’d be able to get off the yacht and ferry my way back to the mainland, I decided to face my fears.;;;;;;;;;
It was time to take the plunge.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In Turkey, it had taken mere minutes for the nausea to hit. I remember being moored up in the marina in Gocek, barely moving, but feeling so, so unwell. I remember finding Dave in our cabin and squeaking out that I didn’t think I could do this, but not knowing how I could possibly get off the yacht in front of all of his friends, having only been on it for all of five minutes. I remember counting down the hours I had left on the water from the moment I’d left solid ground.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In Greece, I took a pessimistic step on to the boat and held my breath.;;;;;;;;;
Nothing.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t feel anything.;;;;;;;;;
And that was really unexpected, because, y’know, I’ve experienced motion sickness in the bath before.;;;;;;;;;
But I felt normal.;;;;;;;;;
I felt fine.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I have some theories about how, suddenly, I seem to have overcome my severe motion sickness.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This year, I finally found the time to do the Whole30 and it was the single best thing I’ve ever done for myself. Hands down. And it was through doing the Whole30 and studying how my body reacts to certain foods that I learned I have an intolerance to histamine. On a low histamine diet, my anxiety dropped from around an 8 to a 1, my hayfever, which often leads to my face swelling up like this, completely disappeared, and you know what else is linked to histamine? Motion sickness. A doctor friend of mine in Lisbon had suggested my seasickness might improve on my new diet, so maybe that’s what it was.;;;;;;;;;
It could have been that, or maybe it was because I tried a new type of motion sickness pill I’d never tried before.;;;;;;;;;
Or maybe it was just that the ocean in Greece really is that freaking flat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A few months before doing the Whole30, Dave and I had checked out the Tall Ships Race in Lisbon — I remember stepping aboard a 150ft boat that was tied up on the river and instantly feeling like I was going to throw up. It was barely moving!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But for some reason, in Greece, I was immune to that sickness. For our entire week in the Ionian, I felt fantastic.;;;;;;;;;
That has never happened before.;;;;;;;;;
So with one less thing to worry about, all I had to face now was my fear of breaking the boat. And with four other people on board to help with the mooring and the sailing, I could thankfully take a backseat for anything that intimidated me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Until I couldn’t.;;;;;;;;;
But before I get into that, let me tell you how much I fell in love with sailing.;;;;;;;;;
Guys, it’s so much fun.;;;;;;;;;
It’s the ultimate form of freedom.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You get to wake up whenever you feel like it, then sit and have breakfast in the warm morning sun. You’ll untie yourself from wherever you moored for the night and set sail in search of a tiny bay with a beautiful beach and nobody else around, because it’s only accessible by boat.;;;;;;;;;
When you find one of these magical spots — which aren’t hard to find at all — you’ll anchor there for the day and spend your afternoon sunbathing on the yacht, jumping in the warm waters, snorkelling with hundreds of fish, drinking Vodka North, and swimming out to your own private beach.;;;;;;;;;
As the sun starts to set, you’ll either decide to spend the night on the anchor in that secluded bay or motor over to a nearby village to moor and eat dinner and chat with other people who were also sailing the Ionian.;;;;;;;;;
It was bliss.;;;;;;;;;
I started talking about how I was going to get my Competent Crew qualification. Asking Dave how viable it would be for us to buy a yacht and spend the rest of our life sailing around the world. Attempting to get everyone to commit to a yacht trip for 2017.;;;;;;;;;
What I loved most was feeling so disconnected from the online world. I wasn’t worried about answering emails or putting up photos on Instagram. I didn’t care about what was happening in the world, because look at where I was.;;;;;;;;;
Even though I had data for our entire trip, I didn’t spend more than five minutes online each day.;;;;;;;;;
I only wanted to be in the moment.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then two members of our crew left the yacht for reasons I won’t get into here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Suddenly, it was just me, Dave, and Dave’s best friend left on board, and that meant that I could take a backseat no more.;;;;;;;;;
I was going to have to play an active role in the sailing and mooring of this yacht, and I had no idea what I was doing.;;;;;;;;;
I was terrified.;;;;;;;;;
I was either going to have to learn how to work the anchor or I was going to have to learn how to use the ropes. Both of which looked like things I would most likely fail at.;;;;;;;;;
And that was so scary because if I screwed up something important while we were trying to moor, it wouldn’t just be a cute story about my stupidity on this site. It would be me damaging something that was probably worth a quarter of a million dollars.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yikes.;;;;;;;;;
The old me would have considered pretending to be unwell to try to get out of my duties, or so that I could have had a valid excuse if I’d managed to screw things up. The old me would have spent our final few days panicking about how we’d moor that night and picturing all the ways it would inevitably go wrong.;;;;;;;;;
And don’t get me wrong: I definitely did a little of that to start with.;;;;;;;;;
But I also knew that the things I worry about almost never actually happen. And if they do happen, they’re never as bad as I’d expected.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So I sat in my cabin listening to my beloved Headspace app for ten minutes or so. I took a swig of vodka. I shook my fears off, and I plunged into the sea.;;;;;;;;;
Literally and figuratively.;;;;;;;;;
And just as I’d predicted, nothing bad happened. Nothing scary happened. Nothing I did put us in any danger. I just had to stand on the back of the boat and do some stuff with the lines that wasn’t all that complicated, and then it was over within minutes.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So how did I overcome my fear of sailing?;;;;;;;;;
By being forced to jump head first into the deep end of my ocean of fears.;;;;;;;;;
"I should have learned by now that that’s the best way to do it.""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408002-401,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/19"",""Hooked on the Cook Islands: My Giant Wedgie"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/hooked-cook-islands-giant-wedgie/"",""Hooked on the Cook Islands: My Giant Wedgie"",""October 7, 2019"",""I hate snorkelling.";;;;;;;;;
Which is weird, right? Because doesn’t everyone love inhaling salty water until they vomit, then being rocked from side to side by the unforgiving ocean until they vomit again, all while several hundred fish swarm around their faces and then one swims all up close to their vagina?;;;;;;;;;
Yeah.;;;;;;;;;
I hate snorkelling for all of those things and more. I just can never seem to get it right: my gear always seems to suck because I’ve never not spent the entire time with seawater in my mask and mouth; I’m always seasick; fish make me nervous; I’m terrified of jellyfish; and I break out in an itchy rash whenever my face is submerged in saltwater for more than a few minutes.;;;;;
I’ve tried so many times to fall in love with it.;;;;;;;;;
I snorkelled in Phang Nga Bay and ended up surrounded by fish — for most people, the goal of snorkelling; for me, the scariest outcome. I snorkelled in a tiny secluded bay in Turkey, where I dived as far down as I could to catch a video of Dave, forgot I couldn’t breathe underwater, inhaled the biggest gulp of water possible, then threw up. I snorkelled in the Maldives and, in an attempt to prevent water from seeping into my mask, secured it too tightly and ended up with a migraine for the next three days.;;;;;;;;
This year, I decided to give it one more shot. I was in Aitutaki, the Cook Islands, where the snorkelling is supposed to be some of the best in the world. If I didn’t like it there, I wouldn’t like it anywhere.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki’s lagoon is more than three times the size of its land, so if you opt to remain on land, you’ll be missing out on a huge portion of what makes the island so special. In other words, I had no excuse. Cruises are popular, and every day, a handful of boats ferry tourists out onto the water, all of them focusing on the underwater world. My lagoon cruise included three snorkelling spots on a full-day tour.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As the engine shuddered to life, I busied myself with focusing on the islands on the horizon to try to keep myself from throwing up. After dropping anchor, we sat and listened to our captain as he ran through a list of things to know.;;;;;;;;;
We’d be snorkelling a shipwreck surrounded by giant trevallies. They were like underwater magpies — attracted by shiny things — so we had to remove our jewellery. All of it. Unless we wanted to be followed by dozens of them for the next hour. I definitely did not.;;;;;;;;;
I snapped my mask over my head and positioned my mouthpiece next to my face. To my surprise, I didn’t feel as nervous as I’d expected. As in, I could stand up and I wasn’t crying.;;;;;;;;;
I wobbled my way over to the side of the boat, watching as everyone either jumped or slid overboard. Following the father of a French family, I clambered up onto the wooden bench and balanced on the hot edge of the boat. Next, I swung my feet over the side so that they were dangling over the water, having made the executive decision to leave my flippers on the boat for now — I was clumsy enough as it was.;;;;;;;;;
I watched the ocean swell beneath me as I contemplated the circling giant trevallies and how they looked just like piranhas in my overly-anxious mind. I took a few deep breaths, reminded myself that I wasn’t nervous, gulped, and then pushed off the side.;;;;;;;;;
And then I stopped.;;;;;;;;;
Something yanked at my crotch and I paused mid-fall. I was submerged up to my knees but the rest of me was somehow managing to dangle in the air.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Oh nooooo!” the French dad cried out from directly in front of me, sending his daughter’s face spinning around in my direction. She let out a gasp.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What was happening?;;;;;;;;;
I let out a perplexed “ack!” as I tried to figure out how I had suddenly learned how to levitate. The pain in my ass crack shook me out of my confusion and I flung my arms behind me to secure myself on the side of the boat with my elbows. A jarring pain shot through my right arm when I smashed it into the side. Only then did it become clear what had just happened.;;;;;;;;;
As I’d pushed myself off into the water, my bikini bottoms had become snagged on something — some kind of hook, maybe, or a cleat for a fender — and there I was: dangling over the side of the boat, desperately thrashing my legs around in the water, and wondering how on earth I could ease the rapidly increasing burn in my vulva.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I kicked my legs back and forth as I contemplated whether it would be best to let go and hope my bikini ripped in half in a way that could be easily repaired, or force myself upwards and back on board.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At one point I tried kicking my legs like a frog, accidentally pausing with them spread wide open, bikini pulled to one side. And there was my vagina.;;;;;;;;;
Hi, everyone! My name is Lauren and I’m the author of the book, How Not to Travel the World. ;;;;;;;;;
“Oh no, oh no, oh no,” the dad groaned as he watched my failed attempts to kick myself back on board. His entire family was in front of me and I was showing them everything I had.;;;;;;;;;
“Goodness!” squeaked out the mum of the British family, who had just spotted my plight.;;;;;;;;;
“Excuse me!” called the dad to the captain, waving his arms in a panic. “I think she might need a little help.”;;;;;;;;;
I forced a grimace that I hoped looked like a calm-and-totally-in-control-of-this-sitatuation smile and I blurted out, “It’s okay! I’m fine! Honestly! I’m just a little stuck!”;;;;;;;;;
Knowing that I had mere moments before the captain spotted me flailing like a moron filled me with a sudden burst of energy. With one final push, I managed to hoist myself up from elbows to my hands, then slide back onto the boat.;;;;;;;;;
“Are you okay?” called out the French dad, who looked more mortified than I felt.;;;;;;;;;
I let out a squeak in return and nodded, staring back at my entire tour group who had just seen my vagina.;;;;;;;;;
"And that was when I decided I would never snorkel again.""";;;;;;;;;

“The weather sucks here,” I’d bemoan, images of Thai islands flashing through my mind. “Everyone’s miserable. They’re always complaining. I hate the rain. The Tube is the worst. Everything’s so expensive. If my family didn’t live here, I’d never return. There’s nothing left for me here.”;;;;;;;;;
I wanted to travel forever.;;;;;;;;;
The first day of my trip. I still had time to pose for a dorky photo, despite being about to miss my flight.;;;;;;;;;
I travelled for nine months and returned to London a changed person. I hadn’t had a panic attack in well over half a year, I was all about trying new foods, I was unbearably optimistic about everything that was going on in my life, and I was eager to share my craziest misadventures with everyone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I landed in the UK and it was raining. Everything was grey. Nothing looked like Southeast Asia. Listening to Bob Marley felt weird. People stared at my hippie pants. Everyone I spoke to was complaining about the weather and work and a hundred other things, and all I could think was, get me out of here.;;;;;;;;;
I left more convinced than ever that there was little left for me in London.;;;;;;;;;
Take me anywhere on this signpost instead of London. Yes, even the toilet.;;;;;;;;;
How wrong I was.;;;;;;;;;
I can blame many things for leading me to hate the UK that first time I returned. I was on a strong course of antibiotics, which always gives me this weird kind of aggressive rage that makes me impossible to be around, plus I don’t think I’d been away for long enough to start yearning for the place I once called home.;;;;;;;;;
The longer I travelled, though, the more I craved London.;;;;;;;;;
I missed my family, and when I returned a year later, I found other things I missed, too. Cathedral City cheese and prawn cocktail-flavoured crisps and not having to put on a fake American drawl and talk about candy and sidewalks and fries and pants and restrooms and drapes and parking lots and jelly so that people could understand what I was talking about.;;;;;;;;;
Returning to London with a traveller’s mindset helped me see the city through new eyes. After spending so long in cities with crap public transport options, the Tube was a dream to use. The rain wasn’t a problem when I didn’t have a job or lecture to go to — I could just stay inside. The cooler temperatures were a relief after several years spent living in humidity. I understood the culture and why people did these weirdass things, because I did them, too. I felt like I fit in.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was hit by the sudden realisation that I adored my home.;;;;;;;;;
There was just one problem: Dave despised London.;;;;;;;;;
He’d lived there for three years around 15 years ago and left swearing never to return. He couldn’t stand the place, for many of the same reasons I gave when I first left.;;;;;;;;;
And it was kind of heart-wrenching to have the person you love tell you they hate where you come from, especially when you’ve just discovered how much of a wonderful city it is.;;;;;;;;;
So I made it my mission to change his mind.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I managed to convince Dave to spend a month in London over Christmas, and I knew I needed to pick an area with a thriving food scene. For many people, the name Brixton brings up memories of the civil unrest and race riots in the 1980s, but those times are long gone and after reading about Brixton Village Market online, I knew it was my best shot at prodding Dave into the box that said, I love London.;;;;;;;;;
The market is all about the food, with articles aplenty claiming Brixton Village to be the most vibrant area in which to stuff your face in London. The sheer amount of cuisines you can find in such a small area was astounding: Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Eritrean, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Pakistani, Portuguese, Ghanian, Colombian, Mediterranean, Algerian, Indonesian, Spanish, Guyanese — I wanted to eat it all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s even a currency, the Brixton pound, in circulation, with the aim of encouraging locals to spend their money in the area, helping to contribute to the local economy.;;;;;;;;;
The more I read, the more excited I became. Brixton sounded like the ideal place for us.;;;;;;;;;
Then, when I stumbled upon the most amazing looking Airbnb apartment, I felt even more that everything had slipped into place. ‘Cause, I mean, when I say it was an apartment, it was actually a house. A house with three floors! We had stairs!;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’d found the perfect area to base ourselves, I just had to get Dave to fall in love. First step: filling his days with some of my favourite London activities.;;;;;;;;;
We hit up The Big Game: a rugby match held every year in Twickenham Stadium on the 27th December, where 70,000 fans gather to drink beer, sing, and watch the local team, the Harlequins… lose.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We went to the top of the Shard to check out the pretty views on a surprisingly bright and sunny morning.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We paid a visit to the West End and the Shaftesbury Theatre to watch Memphis.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We went for a mad hatters-themed afternoon tea at the Sanderson Hotel, where we sipped on pink champagne and drank rhubarb and custard flavoured tea. We marvelled at the salmon and cream cheese sandwiches on lime-flavoured bread, and finished it off with an edible chocolate cup filled with passion fruit mousse and a mango cheesecake and… we didn’t eat for 24 hours after this.;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We checked out Borough market and left with jars of flavoured mustards (Dave went with gherkin and capers (yuck), and I opted for mint and gooseberry) and a huge block of wine-infused cheese.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We had a day of eating in Shoreditch, full of bagels and Vietnamese food and wandering around markets, snapping photos of the street art.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t believe the weather we were having, either. A month in London over January and we had two days of rain. The rest of the time, it was cool, crisp, bright, and full of gorgeous blue skies.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And Dave began to drop into conversation how much fun he was having. About how when you don’t have a 9-5 job, London can actually be an amazing city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As the tides were starting to turn, I pulled the final punch.;;;;;;;;;
We ate everything in Brixton.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Franco Manca is probably the best-known spot in Brixton and for good reason. Their pizzas are incredible, and so are their organic wines (£3.75 a glass). The cured chorizo pizza (£6.95) was by far my favourite. And we may have eaten there half a dozen times over our month-long stay.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The honest burger (£10) from Honest Burgers was amazing. Filled with mature cheddar, smoked bacon, pickled cucumber, and red onion relish, along with a side of rosemary salted chips, it almost brought me to tears. The fresh mint lemonade (£2.50) was perfect for washing it all down.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I had the best pulled pork sandwich of my life at The Joint. Sixteen-hour slow cooked pork, along with candied apple bacon, and coleslaw for £8.50 was my go-to option. Dave often went for the Asian version: spring onion, chilli, and coleslaw with slow cooked shredded chicken. The burgers were massive and messy and you’ll likely have worked your way through 300 napkins by the end of the meal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
>;;;;;;;;;
Elephant serves up Pakistani street food, and I opted for the minced lamb thali (£6.50) so I could try as much of it as possible. So good.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Okan specialises in Osakan street food, and are known for their okonomiyaki — a savoury pancake filled with anything from prawns to kimchi to squid to pork belly to tofu to beef. Impossible to photograph looking delicious, but trust me: it was. I went for the king prawn one at £7.50.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Mama Lan is all about Beijing street food, and we spent a lunchtime meal stuffing our faces with Beijing dumplings: king prawn and Chinese water chestnut (£6.50) was my go-to, while Dave opted for the equally tasty pork and Chinese leaf dumpling (£5.50).;;;;;;;;;
And a special shout out to the insanely spicy goat curry stew packed inside a crumbly roti from the Trinidadian restaurant Fish, Wings and Tings — I devoured it before I got a chance to take a photo, and it was by far the hottest thing I’ve ever eaten.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“I really could live in Brixton,” I confessed to Dave on our final evening in London. “I love our house with our incredible view over the rooftops. I love that we have all of these coffee shops and restaurants and bars close-by that are starting to feel like our locals. The food is so cheap for London! I love the street art and the vinyl record stores and the amazing variety of cuisines you can get here. Hell, I’m even enjoying the weather.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave looked up from behind his laptop and grinned.;;;;;;;;;
“You know what?” he said. “I think I could live here, too.”;;;;;;;;;
Mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;
"Have you been to Brixton? Where else do I need to eat when I return?""";;;;;;;;;

I used to get so angry. I hated having to wait for anything, which I rarely had to do, thanks to a happy and easygoing childhood full of privilege.;;;;;;;;;
Then travel happened, and I left my comfortable life behind, immediately discovering that outside of my cosy bubble, things rarely happened quickly.;;;;;;;;;
Buses break down, the internet is so slow that it won’t load any pages, it takes nine hours of lining up in scorching temperatures to cross a border, you get lost, you get scammed, you miss a flight, it takes someone five minutes to figure out what you need from your hand gestures.;;;;;;;;;
Thanks to travel, I’m basically the most patient person on the planet.;;;;;;;;;
Slow internet? Not a problem. I’ll happily wait five minutes for a page to load, or just realise whatever I needed to do wasn’t so important after all. Bus broke down? It’s cool, I’ll just read a book for a few hours until we’re moving again. I’m not in a rush; it’s no big deal. People are dying; I’m just having to wait an extra few hours than I’d expected.;;;;;;;
So when we were in Belize and our journey from San Ignacio to Placencia started to fall to pieces, I wasn’t phased at all.;;;;;;;;;
I had all the time in the world.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting from our guesthouse in San Ignacio to our one in Placencia ended up a convoluted journey for such a short distance.;;;;;;;;;
There were two options for travelling to Placencia from San Ignacio’s bus station:;;;;;;;;;
Either a bus to Belmopan, a bus to Independence, and a water taxi to Placencia, or a bus to Belmopan, a bus to Dangriga, and a bus to Placencia. Either route would take several hours with the total distance coming in at roughly 125 miles.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The first leg of the journey, to Belmopan, makes for a standard bus ride in Belize. Dave and I arrived at the bus station sweaty, dusty, and looking forward to the day being over. We stepped on to the dry, dusty ground and wandered into the station, greeted by an enormous swarm of frustrated-looking people. It was a Saturday in Belize and it seemed as though every single person in the country was, like us, planning on heading south.;;;;;;;;;
With the southerly-direction buses running only once per hour, we joined the crowd and settled in for a long and boring wait.;;;;;;;;;
Our destination;;;;;;;;;
A very long wait.;;;;;;;;;
Waiting in Belmopan’s bus station felt like waiting for Godot. In front of the queueing area there was a metal fence with a door in it. Whenever a bus would arrive, someone would slowly open the door and a hundred people would try to force their way through the tiny gap and on to the bus. It was like being in a cage. It was like being in school again and shoving people out of the way to see a fight.;;;;;;;;;
After half an hour of waiting, a southerly-heading bus arrived, and Dave and I threw our backpacks on in preparation. When the gate was opened, three people slipped out and we were left waiting in the oven-like bus station.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t believe it.;;;;;;;;;
With roughly 50 people in the crowd ahead of us, we could be waiting in this cage for days.;;;;;;;;;
“What time does the last bus leave for Placencia?” I asked Dave with a laugh.;;;;;;;;;
“6 o’clock,” he told me. “So as long as we’re not stuck here for five hours, we’ll be okay.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I grinned. Like we’d be stuck here for five hours.;;;;;;;;;
Placencia;;;;;;;;;
Allow me to pause here for a moment to tell you about procrastination.;;;;;;;;;
While I was in Belize, I’d signed a lucrative freelance deal that required me to write seven articles a month for a travel company. And, well, I — I do things at the last minute. I procrastinate until the Panic Monster jumps into action and starts screaming in my face.;;;;;;;;;
I had yet to even start writing my articles and my deadline for them was midnight that night.;;;;;;;;;
Now would have been the perfect time to sit down and get everything done, but Belize isn’t a country that’s known for it’s safety. I couldn’t just take out my Macbook and start writing articles in front of everyone unless I was specifically looking to be robbed or come across like a douchebag. Instead, I attempted to mentally compose them in my head, so that I would be able to bash them out quickly before we arrived in Placencia.;;;;;;;;;
If we arrived in Placencia.;;;;;;;;;
An hour later, a second bus pulled up to the terminal, and yes! It was only half-full! There was a decent chance we’d be able to make our way onto this one.;;;;;;;;;
I tightened the waist straps of my backpack and leaned forward as if I was about to start sprinting. In reality, somebody unlocked the door to our waiting cage and the locals threw themselves forwards, shoving me back in the process. Twenty people slipped through and we were still left waiting in our Belizean jail.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I turned to Dave. “I guess we’ll be here for another hour then.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hour by hour, we inched our way through the hot, humid, sticky bus terminal, as glimmers of hope shone through the metal bars only to be extinguished as we repeatedly failed to make it outside.;;;;;;;;;
A third bus arrived with space for only two extra people, and those people were definitely not us.;;;;;;;;;
We’d now been standing in the crowd for two and a half hours and I was rapidly losing my optimism.;;;;;;;;;
I was, however, still patient.;;;;;;;;;
Then something amazing happened.;;;;;;;;;
Two whole buses arrived at the bus station and they were both half-empty.;;;;;;;;;
The station attendant fully opened the door for the first time since we’d arrived and a flood of people surged towards the bus. I felt as though I could cry when I took that step on board and realised we would make it to Placencia after all. I didn’t even care that all of the seats had been taken by locals already, and Dave and I dropped our backpacks in the aisle and sat down on them like the other backpackers were doing.;;;;;;;;;
“No!” the bus driver yelled at us. “No sitting in the aisle. Get off the bus! Wait for the next one.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.;;;;;;;;;
I grabbed my backpack and trudged back into the steaming hot cage of the bus terminal.;;;;;;;;;
We had another hour to wait.;;;;;;;;;
At this point, a taxi driver approached us through the bars and offered to take us to Independence for $150, so we could catch the water taxi to Placencia.;;;;;;;;;
I was seriously close to agreeing to it, but we were first in the queue and I knew we’d be guaranteed a spot on the next bus.;;;;;;;;;
After four and a half hours of waiting, we made it onto a bus.;;;;;;;;;
By this point we couldn’t go to Dangriga, because the final bus to Placencia had already left. Our only option was to take the water taxi from Independence to Placencia, and the final one left at 6 p.m.;;;;;;;;;
We arrived at 6:15.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dejected and disheartened, we trudged off the bus after what had been a truly terrible travel day. Now, we just had to find a guesthouse with a usable internet connection so that we could let our guesthouse owners in Placencia know that we wouldn’t be arriving that evening. And, y’know, for me to write seven articles in under four hours.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We flagged down a taxi and squeezed ourselves and our backpacks inside.;;;;;;;;;
“Placencia?” the driver asked, unconcerned about our late arrival.;;;;;;;;;
“We’ve missed the water taxi,” Dave explained. “The last one is at six.”;;;;;;;;;
Our driver dismissed our concerns. “I’ll take you to the jetty anyway,” he said. “Maybe I can find someone there to take you to Placencia.”;;;;;;;;;
Dave looked at me and I shrugged. “Worth a shot?”;;;;;;;;;
We took off in the direction of the water and I crossed my damp fingers in my lap.;;;;;;;;;
It was dark now, and I had close to no hope that there would be any way of making it across the water. I didn’t know whether to long for an alternative path to Placencia or whether we should be heading straight to Independence so that I could get working as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We rolled to a halt by the water’s edge and our taxi driver immediately leapt into action. I thought about marrying him.;;;;;;;;;
As he jogged towards a group of men, he began asking whether anyone was still heading across the water to Placencia, announcing that he needed to find someone to take us across. The men shrugged in response.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“It’s okay,” Dave called out to him. “We can just spend the night in Independence. It’s no big deal.”;;;;;;;;;
“No, no, no!” the taxi driver called back. “Give me a few minutes.”;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I stood beside the taxi and watched as our driver raced across the dock, stopping to ask anyone and everyone whether they could take us to Placencia.;;;;;;;;;
My jaw dropped when I saw an elderly guy stand up and nod.;;;;;;;;;
“Dave!” I whispered in excitement.;;;;;;;;;
We hauled our backpacks out of the taxi, handed the driver what was most likely one of the best tips of his life, and hopped aboard a small fishing boat.;;;;;;;;;
"Ten minutes later, we were making our way down a sandy path to our guesthouse in Placencia, unbelievably grateful for our unexpected saviour.""";;;;;;;;;

While it may be most famous for its magnificent Angkor Wat, it has so much more to offer its visitors. You’ve got beautiful beaches, spectacular islands, delicious food, hipster cities, so much history, and plenty of welcoming locals. Yes, I absolutely adore Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’m fortunate to have spent three months in the country; splitting my time between four visits and several different travel styles. I backpacked around on an absolute shoestring, visited as part of a couple on a mid-range budget, and even splurged on a little luxury for an unforgettable birthday treat for my partner. Most importantly of all, I tracked every single Riel I spent while I was there.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re wondering how much it costs to travel in Cambodia, this is the post for you!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful, beautiful Koh Rong! I can’t recommend this Cambodian island enough.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What to Know About Money in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cambodia’s currency is called the Riel (KHR) and one U.S. dollar is typically worth 4,000 riels. If you’re thinking that’s going to make calculations difficult, fear not: you’ll barely touch a Riel while you’re in the country.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yes, most people use U.S. dollars in Cambodia, so don’t be surprised to see many prices quoted in USD, although both currencies are accepted everywhere. In convenience stores and markets, you’ll most likely be quoted in Riel. The ATMs dispense U.S. dollars.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You can’t take any Riels outside of Cambodia, so make sure you exchange any before leaving the country or you’ll be stuck with them. This also means you won’t be able to exchange your money into Riels before you arrive in the country. But no worries — U.S. dollars will be more useful in Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
You must visit Angkor Wat while you’re in Cambodia! If you want to escape the crowds, I recommend visiting at sunset instead of sunrise: there was nobody there!;;;;;;;;;

How to Find Cheap Flights to Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’ll be entering Cambodia from anywhere outside of Southeast and East Asia, you’ll be doing so via an indirect route. Yes, direct flights to Cambodia simply don’t exist from Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To find cheap flights from any of these regions, then, my first recommendation is Secret Flying and my second is Skyscanner.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Secret Flying is my number one flying trick and it’s rare for me to ever travel anywhere on a flight that wasn’t found through that website. It’s a flight deals site that shares some of the absolute best prices for airfare that’s recently gone on sale. It’s thanks to Secret Flying that I flew from Lisbon to Cape Town for €280 return, Rome to Japan for €350 return, London to Los Angeles for $120, and Singapore to London for $120. In short, regularly checking flights from your home country to Southeast Asia will help you save a lot of money.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Keep in mind that it’s always far cheaper to fly into Phnom Penh than it is to Siem Reap, as everybody wants to set eyes on the temples of Angkor. When planning your trip, plan your itinerary to kick off in the capital, and it’ll help you save money on flights. I paid $100 to fly from Singapore to Phnom Penh via Siem Reap, and was shocked to see it cost $200 to fly on the exact same flight when finishing in Siem Reap. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
First, check Secret Flying deals to Southeast Asia as a whole from the U.S., Canada, Australia, or wherever else you’re from. You’ll likely be able to pick up a flight to somewhere within the continent — most likely Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur, or Singapore — for as little as €350 return. From there, you can use Skyscanner to find flights to Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of course, if Secret Flying doesn’t have any great deals showing or you want to get to Cambodia with the least amount of hassle, you can use Skyscanner from the get-go. After nine years of continuous travel, it’s my favourite way to search for flights, as I love that you can search for flights from an entire country to Cambodia and that you can search for travel dates across an entire month to ensure you’re flying on the cheapest days.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As always, the more flexible your plans, the easier you’ll find it to save money on flights. If you’re happy to fly into and out of different airports, you may be able to pick up a deal (flying into Phnom Penh and out of Siem Reap, for example), and if you’re happy to visit at any time of year, you’ll be able to pick and choose the best prices, too.;;;;;;;;;

The first of these is hostels. Cambodia has hostels blanketed across the country, and they’re one of your best options for saving money while still making friends. I always recommend staying in hostels if you’re going to be travelling solo!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hostels in Cambodia are similarly priced to Central America or elsewhere in Southeast Asia, so you can get by on not very much at all. You can expect to spend around $5-10 a night for a dorm bed, and $15 for a private room, so if you’re travelling as part of a couple, you may find you end up spending similar amounts for a private room, as opposed to going with two beds in a dorm. In particular, I recommend Onederz in Phnom Penh (they have a pool!) for $8 a night and the epic Cozy Cloud in Siem Reap at $11 a night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re an older traveller on a budget and put off by the thought of staying in hostels, don’t be! You can stay in a private room to still receive privacy and quiet, you’re unlikely to be the oldest person there, and most hostels these days are modern, clean, and centrally located. There are plenty of older travellers in hostels in Cambodia, from middle-aged couples to solo septuagenarians on a trip of a lifetime. As long as you check the reviews of any hostel you book to make sure nobody refers to it as a party hostel, you’ll be all good.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Airbnb is another option that you might want to keep in mind, as staying in a private room (rather than renting out the entire apartment) with a local can often work out to be more affordable as spending a night in a hostel, especially if you’re a couple. Head on over to the Airbnb website and you’ll find accommodation in Cambodia for as little as $5 a night. You’ll be more comfortable than you would be in a hostel and will get to hang out with locals, which is what travel’s all about! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re on a really tight budget, you can stretch your Riels out by making use of some of the free accommodation options in the country. Couchsurfing has been a backpacking staple for over a decade now, and there are thousands of hosts scattered across Cambodia. If a host agrees to let you stay with them, you’ll be able to gain an insight into life in Cambodia that’s always going to be tough to experience when staying with other travellers in hostels.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Housesitting is another option if you’re going to be trying to save as much money as possible but want to stay in nicer accommodation. The best option for Cambodia is Trusted Housesitters, and there are usually a handful of options up for grabs in the country. Housesitting allows you to stay in somebody’s house for free, usually while taking care of their pets, and is a fantastic way to spend more time in Cambodia without breaking the bank.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, when it comes to free accommodation, you could also check out WWOOFing. You’ll receive free lodging and food in exchange for working on a local organic farm for a few hours every day. You’ll likely make tons of new friends, learn a new skill, and see a side of Cambodia that few travellers get to experience. WorkAway is another option in Cambodia that’ll give you a free stay in exchange for a more diverse choice of work (think: volunteering in yoga studios, painting houses, and taking care of children).;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Okay, but what if you’re not a budget traveller and just want to stay in a lovely, well-reviewed hotel or guesthouse that’s good value for money and has all the things you need from a place to lay your head? I’ve got you! I’ve visited Cambodia on both a mid-range and high-end budget, and was blown away by how much I could get for my money. For around $60 a night, you’ll be able to stay in a seriously impressive hotel. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here are some of my favourite spots in the country:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Siem Reap: Primefold Hotel ($140 a night);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Talk about an incredible hotel! Primefold Hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in, and I’ve racked up 450 hotel stays over my nine years of travel! The staff are simply incredible, greeting you with free gifts, writing sweet goodnight messages each night, and doing everything to help you get the most out of your stay in Siem Reap. The pool is gorgeous, the rooms are luxurious as hell, and it’s in a wonderful central location. Yes, it’s a splurge, but it’s also entirely worth it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Kampot: RikiTikiTavi ($65 a night);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve stayed at RikiTikiTavi twice now, because I loved my first visit so much. It’s a wonderful guesthouse in a central location, right on the banks of the river. It makes it a particularly epic spot for catching the sunset in the bar each evening. The staff are wonderful, the rooms luxurious, and it’s easy to hire motorbikes through reception to ride into Kep and back. I wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else in Kampot! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Koh Kong: 4 Rivers Floating Lodge ($300 a night);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yep, this was definitely a hotel I visited on my high-end trip to Cambodia! But what a mind-blowing spot. This floating hotel is located atop the Tatai River, in the southwest corner of the country, a few miles from the Thai border and surrounded by jungle. Nobody visits this part of Cambodia! You need to take a half hour boat journey to get there, and when you arrive? Nothing but silence. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At 4 Rivers Floating Lodge, you’ll find no roads and no neighbours. It’s only accessible by boat and you’ll spend your time floating on the water in a permanent state of bliss. It’s like nowhere I’ve stayed anywhere in the world. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You have free use of the kayaks to explore Koh Andet, formerly a refuge from the Khmer Rouge and now home to a dozen farming families. Most of the hotel’s staff come from there. You also have access to inflatable rings to float in down the river — a cold Angkor beer in hand — and we even received a free evening cruise to go firefly spotting in the jungle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was one of my best travel experiences ever.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Transportation in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cambodia’s a small country and it’s home to a solid public transportation system.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Most people get around the country by bus, as it’s affordable and easy to book online. The buses are generally high-quality, although the roads can be poor, so expect a bumpy journey at times. Giant Ibis is the biggest and best bus company in Cambodia covering most destinations in the country. Their buses come equipped with A/C, Wi-Fi, power sockets, and snacks. You can expect to spend around $10 for each bus ride.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of the best aspects of travel in Cambodia is hitting the water and heading out to the islands. Koh Rong is most popular destination, but Rabbit Island is a great option if you like to head off the beaten track. The ferries cost around $12.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re travelling in a group, you may find it more affordable to hire a private taxi through 12Go Asia and split the cost between you. If a bus is $15 each, for example, and a taxi is $100 and there’s four of you, it’s probably worth paying the extra $10 to have a more comfortable journey. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For shorter distances, taxis and tuk-tuks are prevalent, and Grab (the Uber of Southeast Asia) is available within Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wouldn’t recommend hiring a car in Cambodia. The roads are bad, it’s tricky to get your hands on a Cambodian driving license, and simply isn’t worth the effort and hassle it’ll take to get it all set up. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I also want to mention flying in Cambodia. If you’re short on time, you may want to jump on a plane to skip the bad roads. I flew between Siem Reap and Phnom Penh and from Kampot to Siem Reap and paid around $50 for each of the flights with Angkor Air.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here are some typical overland transportation costs you’ll come up against while you’re travelling in Cambodia. All prices are correct as of August 2020:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus ride from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap: $10Bus ride from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh: $9Bus ride from Sihanoukville to Kampot: $7Motorbike hire from Kampot to Kep and back: $4Ferry from Sihanoukville to Koh Rong: $12Ferry from Kep to Rabbit Island and back: $7;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Food in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cambodian food is often overlooked by travellers in Southeast Asia; mistakenly viewed as being bland and boring in comparison to fiery Thai dishes and complex Vietnamese soups. Don’t buy into the rumours: there’s plenty of delicious dishes to sink your teeth into in Cambodia. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food in Cambodia is delicious and inexpensive, and you’ll never find yourself complaining about the cost of a meal. If you’re on a tight budget, meals can be had for as little as $1, which makes saving money incredibly easy. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you want to impress your friends back home and sample something truly adventurous, add the town of Skuon to your Cambodian itinerary. This spider-filled town is packed full of tarantulas and everywhere you go, you’ll find them fried up, piled high, and ready to be eaten. The cost? 2,000 Riels, or 50 cents.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cambodia’s tap water is unfortunately not safe to drink, so you’ll want to either buy bottled water or use a Steripen to safely purify the tap water and cut down on plastic. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In Southeast Asia and especially in Cambodia, I don’t recommend cooking your own food, unless you have a strict dietary requirement. Buying ingredients for meals is simply too expensive — you can spend $10-15 on ingredients for a dish that you can get for $2 on the streets.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Street food is typically safe in the country, and I recommend sampling it often. If in doubt, look to the locals. They aren’t going to eat at places that will make them sick, so if you see a popular spot with a line of hungry Cambodians, that’s a good sign you should grab some of whatever they’re eating. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And as for restaurants, they’re everywhere and reasonably affordable compared to the street food goodness. A two-course meal with a beer will come to around $10.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Speaking of beer, you can usually grab a can for around $1 — less if you’re buying it from a convenience store — so drinking is fairly cheap. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In general, I’d recommend expecting to spend around $7 a day if you’re on a tight backpacker budget, $20 a day if you’ll be occasionally eating in restaurants, and $50 a day if you plan on eating at higher-end restaurants.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Activities in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to activities in Cambodia, you’re probably picturing one major attraction: Angkor freaking Wat. Of course it’s the one thing you have to do while you’re in the country. Yes, it’s going to be crowded and yes, if you’re backpacking, it’s going to stretch your budget, but trust me — it’s so, so worth it. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And if you hate crowds, it’s super-easy to get awa from them. On my third visit to Cambodia, I knew I wanted to see the lesser-visited structures of Angkor and it was so easy to do. I hired a tuk-tuk driver for the day and asked him to take me to the quietest ruins where there would be no other tourists; to show me his favourite monuments.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent a fantastic day clambering over ruins, wandering through the jungle, and seeing just five or six people over the entire day. It was so worth the $37 for a one-day pass. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As of 2020, the cost of the three-day pass is $62 and the seven-day pass is $74. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But what else is there to do in Cambodia? There’s plenty to keep you busy in this country, even if you don’t have much money to spend.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite free things to do is explore the Cambodian coastline. Sihanoukville, Koh Rong, even Rabbit Island if you want to get away from the crowds. I loved cafe-hopping in Phnom Penh. Kampot is full of the most delicious food and Kep is all about the crabs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Something I love to do when I travel is take tours! I always book mine through Viator, no matter where I am in the world. Here’s an idea of the costs you can expect to be up for with these tours:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Khmer cooking class in Siem Reap: £19Islands of the Mekong guided bike tour from Phnom Penh: £38Cambodian arts and dance show in Phnom Penh: £12Siem Reap countryside bike tour: £28Phnom Penh street food night market tour: £47Climbing, caving, and abseiling in Kampot: £40Explore Siem Reap’s floating villages: £44;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The beautiful views from a waterfront restaurant I was eating at in Kampot. I spent a lot of time gazing out at the pretty scenery while I was in town ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Miscellaneous Expenses for Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cambodian visa: You can grab a 30-day tourist visa when you arrive for $30, although expect to pay a little more in bribes if you’ll be crossing overland into the country.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Cambodia guidebook: A guidebook will give you an in-depth look into Cambodian culture, suggest the perfect itineraries for the amount of time you have, and offer recommendations for where to eat and what’s worth doing. I always opt for Lonely Planet guidebooks and their Cambodia offering receives great reviews for around $18.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Cambodian SIM card: I picked up a SIM card when I arrived in Cambodia in Phnom Penh and went with CellCard — you need to show your passport in order to get set-up. I paid $1 for the SIM card and $2 for 4GB of data. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance: While I was travelling in Cambodia, I fell over, scraped my knee on the sidewalk, got an infection in the wound, and twisted my ankle. Yes, it was quite an experience. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve read any other posts on Never Ending Footsteps, you’ll know that I’m a great believer in travelling with travel insurance. I’ve seen far too many Go Fund Me campaigns from destitute backpackers that are unexpectedly stranded in a foreign country after a scooter accident/being attacked/breaking a leg with no way of getting home or paying for their healthcare. If you can’t be treated in Cambodia, where the healthcare isn’t amazing, you’ll potentially need to be airlifted to Thailand, Singapore, or Hong Kong. These costs can quickly land you with a six-figure bill to pay at the end of it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In short, if you can’t afford travel insurance, you can’t afford to travel.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance will cover you if your flight is cancelled and you need to book a new one, if your luggage gets lost and you need to replace your belongings, if you suddenly get struck down by kidney stones and have to be hospitalised, have your camera stolen and need to buy a replacement, or discover a family member has died while you’re overseas and need to get home immediately. If you fall seriously ill, your insurance will cover the costs to fly you home to receive medical treatment.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve used World Nomads as my travel insurance provider since 2012, have had zero issues when making a claim with them, and have nothing but wonderful things to say about them.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you squint, you can spot me hanging out in the entranceway of this incredible ruin at Angkor!;;;;;;;;;

How Much Does it Cost to Travel in Cambodia?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
With all that being said, how much can you expect to spend on a trip to Cambodia? How much should you budget if you plan to visit for a week, two weeks, or even a month?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I always end my budget breakdowns with the daily costs of my cumulative time spent in a country, as I know it’ll help you better plan out any upcoming travel expenses. In this case, because I visited Cambodia on both the backpacking and higher-end of the budget spectrum, I’m going to separate out my personal expenses into two sections. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From six weeks of backpacking in Cambodia, my costs averaged: ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation: $8 a day;;;;;;;;;
Transportation: $5 a day;;;;;;;;;
Food: $16 a day;;;;;;;;;
Activities and entrance fees: $2 a day;;;;;;;;;
Total amount spent: $31 a day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From three weeks of mid-range-to-luxury travel in Cambodia, my costs averaged: ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation: $80 a day;;;;;;;;;
Transportation: $7 a day;;;;;;;;;
Food: $21 a day;;;;;;;;;
Activities and entrance fees: $2 a day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Total amount spent: $110 a day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As you can undoubtedly see, Cambodia is a high-value travel destination that can be visited on the most shoestring of budgets. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you have the ability to splurge while you’re in the country, you’ll land yourself with some wonderful rooms and experiences, but the country is just as spectacular when you’re backpacking around. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But don’t you dare think about skipping Angkor Wat to save some money :-);;;;;;;;;

"Is the cost of travel in Cambodia more or less than you expected? Sound off in the comments below!""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408028-409,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/18"",""Why Huahine is My Favourite Island in the South Pacific"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/huahine-favourite-island-south-pacific/"",""Why Huahine is My Favourite Island in the South Pacific"",""August 15, 2020"",""When I was planning my South Pacific trip, I had an image in my mind of what my dream island would look like. It would have beautiful scenery that encompassed beaches, jungles, ruins, lagoons, and volcanoes, along with friendly locals, great food, the ability to visit on a budget, and plenty of options for activities.";;;;;;;;;
Well, I’m pleased to say that I found an island just like that. It’s called Huahine and it’s perfect.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s what made it the highlight from my month in the South Pacific:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s the Most Affordable Island I Visited;;;;;;;;;
Huahine was one of the cheapest islands I visited in French Polynesia and the South Pacific in general. And yes, I. know. it’s. not. Southeast. Asia. cheap., but this is a paradise island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in a region that has a reputation for being one of the most expensive in the world. When you take that into account, I found it offered great value for money!;;;;;;;;;
I stayed at Pension Fare Ara for $43 a night, which included breakfast, an airport pickup, and a friendly puppy to play with. The guesthouse was a ten-minute walk from the best beach on the island (and probably the best one I found in all of French Polynesia!), and a dozen great restaurants. The owner was lovely and had a ton of advice for off-the-beaten-track activities, and there were bicycles to rent, too. I would totally stay here again and highly recommend it.;;;;;;;;;
For cheaper accommodation options, you can camp at Camping Hiva Plage ($12 a night for a tent) over where the surfing is best on the island, and there are a couple of other guesthouses on HotelsCombined for around $40 a night.;;;;;;;;;
Everything else is inexpensive, too: I hired a bicycle for $5 a day, lunches were around $10 and dinners were $15.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I guess I just didn’t feel like I was being ripped off on Huahine, and I’d definitely felt that way on other South Pacific islands — I’m looking at you and your grocery store prices, Aitutaki.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s a Seriously Spectacular Beach;;;;;;;;;
I fully expected the best beach I’d visit in French Polynesia would be on Bora Bora, but it was this gorgeous one on Huahine that stole my heart instead. Just look at those colours!;;;;;;;;;
Fare Beach had dazzling white sand as soft as icing sugar, a warm, calm ocean that was turquoise blue and so clear I could see my toes when paddling neck-deep. It was peaceful: there were no car engines, no music, no loud conversations — just the sound of the sea lapping gently at the shore. And it was surrounded by beautiful scenery: palm trees slightly back from the beach and a jungle-clad volcano further inland.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are So Few Tourists;;;;;;;;;
Huahine is one of the least populated islands in the Society Islands, and it’s not filled with tourists either. With only eight small villages dotted around the 20-miles-in-circumference island and 5,000 residents, hopping on a bicycle and riding for just a few minutes is all it takes to feel like you’re on your own private island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The photo of the beach I posted above? That wasn’t an artful angle to make it seem as though I had it all to myself: it was actually just everyone who was on the beach! Whenever I spent my afternoons sunbathing there, I never had to share that spot of sand with more than three people at once.;;;;;;;;;
Away from the beaches, the island is just as quiet. As I explored by bike, the roads were often deserted, with a car passing me by only every ten minutes or so. When I went to see some ruins, I had them all to myself. When I went on a hike, I didn’t meet a single person.;;;;;;;;;
In some respects, it’s not all that surprising, because have you even heard of Huahine? I know that I hadn’t until I started to plan this trip. But it’s also kind of shocking at the same time, because Huahine is a 30 minute flight from Tahiti and a 30 minute flight from Bora Bora. It’s so easy to get there from the main tourist hubs of the region, but so few people make the journey.;;;;;;;;;
And honestly, unlike some places I’ve visited (Maafushi, in the Maldives, for example, which I recently learned is now absolutely overrun with tourists and has had its beautiful beach dug up), I don’t think it’s going to change any time soon. There purposely isn’t much tourism infrastructure on the island, there are no major hotels or resorts, and I didn’t see or hear any construction going on. Unless Huahine receives some kind of major publicity, I can see it continuing being overlooked in favour of Tahiti and Bora Bora for many years to come.;;;;;;;;;
And that’s definitely a reason for me to return.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Scenery is Breathtaking;;;;;;;;;
Huahine has everything you could possibly desire from a South Pacific island. You’ve got amazing white sand beaches, palm trees lining every road, extinct volcanoes to climb, glistening lagoons to paddle in, dense jungle, old Polynesian ruins to explore, smooth roads to cycle along, vanilla bean plantations to wander around…;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
No matter where you are in Huahine and what direction you’re looking in, I guarantee there’ll be something beautiful before you.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s a Ton of Ancient Ruins;;;;;;;;;
The ruins on Huahine are said to be as significant as the ones on Easter Island, which is pretty cool, I guess. <— Not a person who likes ruins.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But in all seriousness, Huahine is covered in ancient Polynesian ruins, and they’re all free to visit and clamber over. And although they do now look like piles of coral and stone, they used to be religious temples; sites where human and animal sacrifices took place; places for villagers to build canoes and braid ropes. James Cook is said to have witnessed a sacrifice here. There’s even some 400-year-old fishing traps made of stone that are still in use today.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You Can Feed Sacred Blue-Eyed Eels;;;;;;;;;
Here’s a really bad photo of them.;;;;;;;;;
One of the things I was most excited about seeing in Huahine is the sacred blue-eyed eels. You’ll find them swimming around in a river in the village of Faie, where they’re worshipped by the locals. Pull up alongside the riverbank and you’ll find a small stall where you can buy tins of mackerel to feed them.;;;;;;;;;
While I was there, a couple of small children were running around in the river, wrapping their arms around the eels and raising them up in the air to show them to me. Given that the eels grow to six foot in length, this was no mean feat. And fun fact: I just misspelled eel as eek and that feels very appropriate.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Rather than joining the kids in the water, because the eels were creeping me out, I decided to stare into their bright blue eyes instead. Which was probably just as creepy, to be honest.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s So Much to Keep You Busy;;;;;;;;;
I spent three days on the island and left feeling like there was so much more I wish I’d been able to see.;;;;;;;;;
Huahine is actually comprised of two large islands, which are connected by a narrow strip of land. I saw maybe a quarter of one of the islands, and none of the other.;;;;;;;;;
I missed out on so many beautiful beaches, and I especially wanted to check out the ones the locals surf at to see what they’re like. I wanted to check out several different hikes to viewpoints around the volcano, but it was raining when I tried. I didn’t get a chance to visit the vanilla bean plantations. I couldn’t find the time to take a boat across to the black pearl farm. And I missed the whole other island of Huahine.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I feel like I could easily spend a week on this island before I started getting itchy feet.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Huahine Looks Like a Pregnant Woman;;;;;;;;;
Huahine means pregnant woman in Tahitian, and that’s because when you stand in the main village of Fare and look to the left, the hills look like a pregnant woman lying down. My guesthouse owner parked up here and said, “Look! Can you see her boobies?”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s no doubt that Huahine was my favourite island from my entire South Pacific trip. It has the scenery, the friendly locals, the affordability, the great accommodation options, good food, plenty to see and do…;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I’ve been writing about French Polynesia, I’ve found myself planning returns to this region to check out some of the other island groups. If I do manage to make it back, though, I think I’ll struggle to not return to Huahine.;;;;;;;;;

Birthdays, Christmases, anniversaries (every month!), travelversaries (also every month!), and more. If there’s something to celebrate, I’ll be there with a gift in hand.";;;;;;;;;
And celebrating special occasions on the road makes for an even more meaningful experience, as there’s no excuse not to take a trip to somewhere new and beautiful.;;;;;;;;;
Back when Dave and I were living in Sayulita, the little hippie beachtown in Mexico where we spent three months, our two-year anniversary rolled around and we immediately started researching romantic getaways.;;;;;;;;;
I stumbled across Yelapa, a tiny fishing village that’s roughly twenty miles south of Puerto Vallarta. It’s only accessible by boat, there wasn’t even electricity until 10 years ago, and a widespread Internet connection only arrived in 2010. There aren’t any cars in the village, with locals and visitors opting to get around on horseback or by foot, instead. There are no chain restaurants or hotels, the beaches are beautiful, and the articles I’d read described it as Mexico’s last authentic beach town. I’m sure that’s not the case, but either way, it looked lovely and we immediately started making plans to visit.;;;;;;;;;
Gorgeous Yelapa;;;;;;;;;
The only problem was the price.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back then, we were both dedicated budget travellers, so looking at hotels and not being able to find anything for under $100 a night had us eventually deciding to stay in Sayulita instead. But then I discovered something:;;;;;;;;;
Me: “Dave…”;;;;;;;;;
Dave: “Yes?”;;;;;;;;;
“You know how we really want to go to Yelapa?”;;;;;;;;;
“Yep.”;;;;;;;;;
“But that it’s really expensive.”;;;;;;;;;
“Mmm hmm.”;;;;;;;;;
“Well, how would you feel about staying in a hotel without any walls?”;;;;;;;;;
He blinked at me.;;;;;;;;;
The view from our bungalow;;;;;;;;;
I was talking about Yelapa Oasis, a jungle hideaway that still cost $90 a night, but looked like a chilled-out kind of spot. Reviewers described it as peaceful, romantic, and unique.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, Dave was game for a wallless getaway and so was I. We jumped on a bus down to Boca, took a water taxi to Yelapa, and two hours later we were there, in a tropical paradise being devoured by mosquitoes.;;;;;;;;;
Just kidding. There weren’t any bugs, thank god.;;;;;;;;;
There were, however, giant toads who kept finding their way into our room.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave had to keep chasing them out with a broom.;;;;;;;;;
Occasionally a giant iguana would wander inside, too.;;;;;;;;;
So what’s it like to stay somewhere that’s so open to the elements? Well, here’s a couple of photos so you can get an idea of what exactly it looked like. I had been picturing a bed on a patch of grass with nothing else around it, but it wasn’t quite as rustic as that.;;;;;;;;;
This was the view from the bedroom. No walls, no blinds, no screens, nothing!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I took this photo standing beside the hammock and looking back towards the bedroom. Fortunately, we had a mosquito net over the bed, and there was a small wooden screen if we wanted some privacy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Honestly? We both loved staying somewhere that brought us so close to nature.;;;;;;;;;
I always make an effort to stay in quirky accommodation around the world, and this definitely ticked that box. It even felt safe there, which I wasn’t expecting, given that obviously we didn’t have a door to lock or anywhere to keep our stuff safe. I browsed through the TripAdvisor reviews, too, and couldn’t see anyone complaining about theft.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Because there’s only four bungalows in the entire complex, you rarely saw anybody else and the only noises to disturb us were the chirping of crickets as we fell asleep and the crowing of roosters as we awoke.;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite aspects, though? Whenever we wanted to go to the beach or back to our room, we could take the direct route through the river.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, that was pretty badass.;;;;;;;;;
So, aside from chasing toads and iguanas out of our bedroom, what else did we get up to in Yelapa?;;;;;;;;;
We caught some spectacular sunsets from the hammock. After a hard day of napping, of course.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We spent a serious amount of time on Yelapa’s tiny beach.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We wandered into the main part of town for dinner every night — yep, this is the most built-up part of Yelapa.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And to ensure we weren’t too lazy, we hiked to a waterfall, which was just a ten minute walk from our bungalow.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that was our romantic weekend away!;;;;;;;;;

I loved our time in Yelapa. It’s a a place that isn’t really well-known, takes a little bit of work to get to, and doesn’t have a huge amount of things for you to do there. But that’s exactly why it’s so great. It deters the crowds of tourists and leaves you with a near-empty beach and a look at what a small Mexican fishing village is truly like.;;;;;;;;;
Yelapa is a place for you to swing in your hammock with your Kindle in hand, sunbathe on the beach, and chase toads out of your bedroom.;;;;;;;;;
It was perfect for our anniversary.;;;;;;;;;

I hadn’t travelled alone before, and never for more than two weeks at a time. Travel was brand new and I had no idea what I was doing.";;;;;;;;;
I made a lot of mistakes over the past eight years.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve been scammed in Russia, China, Laos, the Maldives, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka.;;;;;;;;;
I managed to lose half the things I was originally travelling with.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve got lost more times than I can count. Homesick, too.;;;;;;;;;
I fell down the largest sand dune in Africa.;;;;;;;;;
Caught cholera in Borneo.;;;;;;;;;
Had a rabies scare in India.;;;;;;;;;
Got caught up in a tsunami in Thailand.;;;;;;;;;
Was stranded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.;;;;;;;;;
But I’ve learned a ton from my experiences, too. To celebrate a full decade since I stumbled my way out of the U.K. and began a life of full-time travel, I’ve compiled an enormous list of my biggest and best travel tips. These are all things that I wish someone had told me before I started traveling, so I hope you’ll find them useful, inspiring, educational, and entertaining.;;;;;;;;;
Brace yourselves, because this is a long one! It’s time to start learning from my mistakes :-);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
1. Eat the local food;;;;;;;;;
One of my biggest regrets from the first year of my travels was that I wasn’t brave enough to try any of the local food. I was raised a picky eater and that, combined with debilitating anxiety and an eating disorder, led to me believing that I would either hate or be allergic to anything I hadn’t tried before.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was so, so wrong.;;;;;;;;;
Food is now my absolute favourite way to get to know a place better.;;;;;;;;;
I love trying new things, and I’ve found a thousand amazing dishes that I never would have discovered if I’d continue to eat from supermarkets around the world. Trying new food isn’t scary, and you’ll build your confidence up as you fall in love with more and more things.;;;;;;;;;
Try everything, even if you have no idea what it is. I promise you won’t regret it. Or fall straight into anaphylactic shock.;;;;;;;;;
2. Plan as little as possible;;;;;;;;;
One of the first lessons I learned on the road was that your plans will nearly always change. You’ll arrive in a place and hate it and want to leave immediately, or you’ll fall in love with a destination and want to spend longer there. You’ll make friends with a group of awesome people and want to change your plans so you can travel with them for longer, or you’ll find out about an amazing-sounding town that’s nearby and want to head there instead.;;;;;;;;;
Sure, you should have a rough plan for your trip, but don’t book everything in advance or you’ll likely feel too restricted and end up regretting it.;;;;;;;;;
Book a one-way ticket and your first few nights of accommodation — you’ll figure the rest out along the way. It’s not as intimidating as it sounds. If you’re in a tourist destination there’ll always be someone who’s willing to take your money by giving you a place to stay.;;;;;;;;;
3. Travel insurance is everything;;;;;;;;;
Seriously.;;;;;;;;;
If you do only one thing before you leave, make it getting travel insurance. I’ve heard far too many horror stories of travellers injuring themselves in remote places and ending up in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt. Don’t think that it won’t happen to you, because you know those travellers thought that, too.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve use World Nomads for my travel insurance provider for six years and recommend them to everyone I know. They were fantastic to deal with when making a claim.;;;;;;;;;
4. Carry around spare passport photos;;;;;;;;;
People laughed at me when I said that I was carrying around a dozen spare passport photos, but they’ve been incredibly useful and saved me a ton of time and hassle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Who wants to wander the streets of some rural town in Cambodia searching for someone who can take your photo? Friends of mine had to do this!;;;;;;;;;
I’ve used them to apply for visas around the world, to get a new passport when mine expired while I was on the other side of the planet, and I even needed one to buy a local SIM card in Nepal! Having spares in my backpack meant that I didn’t have to waste a day researching and then wandering around a city to try to find someone who could take a passport-sized photo of me.;;;;;;;;;
5. Keep everything important in your daypack;;;;;;;;;
I’m fortunate to have never had to deal with lost luggage, but I did have my backpack ripped open on a flight and I was grateful to have not had anything valuable in it at the time. I’ve also been on dodgy buses in Southeast Asia where we’ve arrived at our destination and people have had items stolen by someone hiding out in the luggage hold while we were transit.;;;;;;;;;
If there’s anything I’d be upset to lose, I keep it in my daypack, which is always by my side on travel days. For me, that’s my passport, laptop, camera, external hard drive, a debit card, and some spare cash. As long as I have all of these, I can survive indefinitely.;;;;;;;;;
Hanging out in a clog in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
6. Wear sunscreen every day;;;;;;;;;
When you travel, you’re in the sun more than most people thanks to months of island-hopping and beach time, as well as entire days spent outside exploring. Wear sunscreen every single day, regardless of the weather and temperature, because you really don’t want your trip of a lifetime to result in skin cancer or a body that’s blanketed in leathery wrinkles.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wear sunscreen on my face and chest every day, even in the middle of winter.;;;;;;;;;
7. Take more photos of yourself;;;;;;;;;
There have been so many times when I’ve been too shy to ask someone to take my photo in a place and I’ve almost always regretted it. After eight years of travel, I probably only have around 200 photos of me around the world. Photos of the beautiful places you visit are great and all, but when you get home, they’re not all that different to the ones everyone else has taken there, too. Photos with you in them are special and they’ll mean a lot more to you when you look back at them.;;;;;;;;;
Or maybe I’m just a narcissistic millennial.;;;;;;;;;
8. Learn a few words of the language in every country you visit;;;;;;;;;
You’ll gain more respect from the locals if you can at least say hello, please, sorry, and thank you. On that note, remember: if you don’t speak the language, it’s your problem, not theirs. And please don’t start speaking louder to make yourself understood. Try miming instead, or using a translation app on your phone.;;;;;;;;;
9. Bring ear plugs and a sleep mask;;;;;;;;;
Travel isn’t conducive for sleep, whether it’s snorers in dorm rooms, early risers rustling plastic bags, or drunk backpackers stumbling around in the middle of the night. Even if you don’t stay in hostels, you’ll still have to deal with street noise from outside, loud bars nearby, and uncomfortable overnight journeys. Pack some ear plugs and a sleep mask in your bag to help improve your sleep. I’ve been using Sleep Phones to block out light and listen to podcasts and I love them.;;;;;;;;;
10. Space saver bags will help you fit more in your backpack;;;;;;;;;
I’d always been all about the packing cubes, until I discovered vacuum-sealed versions of them! You throw your clothes in, seal the bag, then roll it up to push out all the air. I can literally fit twice as many clothes in my backpack when I use these! Even if you don’t want to carry more things in your bag, it frees up so much space that if you need to pack in a hurry, you can just chuck everything in.;;;;;;;;;

Sometimes your bank will block your card, sometimes your card won’t work in an ATM, and sometimes you could even lose it or have it stolen. Bring at least three debit/credit cards with you that are all linked to different accounts (with money in them!) Keep one in your backpack, one in your daypack, and one on your person.;;;;;;;;;
It’s being a little paranoid, sure, but you’ll be glad you did it if you happen to misplace your card.;;;;;;;;;
12. And a stash of emergency cash;;;;;;;;;
I carry a spare 300 USD that’s split up in various places in my backpack, daypack, and occasionally, my shoe when I’m nervous I’ll be robbed. It means that in a worse-case scenario, I can pay for some food, a dorm bed, and a Skype call to my family to get an emergency wire transfer until I can get back on my feet again. I went with U.S. dollars because it’s the most widely accepted currency around the world and easy to change.;;;;;;;;;

13. Don’t be put off a destination if you can’t find much information about it;;;;;;;;;
When I decided to see if it was possible to visit the Maldives on a budget back in 2014, information was so sparse that I couldn’t even find a photo of the islands I’d decided to visit. Well, that trip was one of my highlights of the past eight years and I’m so glad I went, despite not being able to find any information online. And the advantage to that lack of information was getting to be the only tourist on an entire island — I had the whole beach to myself!;;;;;;;;;
If you know it’s safe to travel somewhere, but can’t find out much else, go for it. It’s probably far easier to get there than you think. And if not, it makes for a good story.;;;;;;;;;
14. Expect everything to go wrong;;;;;;;;;
I’m definitely testament to that! But expecting everything to go perfectly on your trip is only setting yourself up to fail. Nobody goes travelling and comes back without any stories of mishaps. No matter how prepared you are, at some point you’re going to get lost, get scammed, miss your bus, get food poisoning, injure yourself… the list is endless! Expect it to happen, and don’t beat yourself up when it does. In a month’s time, you’ll find it funny rather than frustrating.;;;;;;;;;
15. And don’t lose your temper when it does;;;;;;;;;
It achieves absolutely nothing and makes you look like an asshole. Instead, calm down, put a smile on your face, think of how this will make a great story one day, and rationally figure out an alternative plan.;;;;;;;;;
This too shall pass.;;;;;;;;;
A beach to myself in the Maldives!;;;;;;;;;
16. Write down the address of your accommodation before you arrive;;;;;;;;;
What happens if you arrive in a city, go to grab your email confirmation for your accommodation, and your phone and laptop are out of battery? I always make sure I have a hard copy of my guesthouse name and their address, as well as directions if I won’t be taking a taxi. Once I arrive, I’ll grab one of the hotel’s business cards, so I’ll always know where I’m staying, and can show it to locals to ask for help with finding my way back.;;;;;;;;;

17. If you live in jeans normally, travel with them, too;;;;;;;;;
So many people will tell you not to travel with jeans, but if you wear jeans all the time at home, you’ll want to wear them while travelling, too. I didn’t start travelling with jeans until my second year of travel, and man, I missed them so much! They’re not *that*  bulky so you really don’t need to worry about the extra space and weight. And in many cities in Europe, you’ll want to wear jeans to fit in with the locals — you don’t want to look like a grubby backpacker in Paris!;;;;;;;;;
18. Back up everything in multiple places;;;;;;;;;
Imagine how you’d feel if you lost every single photo from your trip. You really don’t want that to happen, so back everything up, in multiple places. My tech journalist boyfriend always reminds me that anything that’s stored in one place is something you don’t mind losing.;;;;;;;;;
I keep copies of my photos on my laptop, back all of my photos up to an external hard drive, and use Crashplan to backup the entire contents of my laptop to the cloud. I highly recommend using the latter!;;;;;;;;;

19. Visit the touristy stuff in a city;;;;;;;;;
The main tourist attractions are popular for a reason. While getting off the beaten track can be fun, the things you’ll see are rarely as impressive as the popular sights. Don’t be a travel snob — hit up the famous stops as well as the lesser-visited stuff. Going to random places normally just shows you that they aren’t well known for a reason.;;;;;;;;;
I’m thinking about my 10-day road trip around the Mekong Delta as I write this — we went to some obscure places where locals looked at me as though they hadn’t seen a white person before, and while that was pretty cool, there was also a reason why tourists hadn’t ventured to this tiny village before: there was nothing to do there.;;;;;;;;;
20. Have a routine when checking out of a place;;;;;;;;;
Checking out is when you’re most likely to lose something. Whenever I check out of a place, I check the bathroom, I check under the beds, I check the desks, and then I make sure I have my passport, laptop, camera, money, phone, and external hard drive. I’ll be fine if I leave anything else behind. Having a routine that you go through every single time will help you keep track of everything. I learned my lesson with this one when I left my passport behind in a guesthouse in Bagan, then left it in an apartment in London two months later.;;;;;;;;;
At the Grand Canyon;;;;;;;;;
21. Let your bank know you’ll be travelling;;;;;;;;;
I’m not exaggerating when I tell you that my bank blocked my card something like 30 times in the first three years of my trip. Practically every time I arrived in a new country, I had to call them up to get it unblocked.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then I discovered that I could fill in my travel plans in my online banking. They’ve rarely blocked my card since.;;;;;;;;;
22. If you’re not sure if you should bring it, don’t;;;;;;;;;
The lighter your backpack, the better. If in doubt, leave it behind. Trust me, you can buy pretty much anything you could possibly need in most places around the world. You’ll soon learn that all you need when you travel is a change of clothes, some money, and a passport. Everything else is adding to your comfort.;;;;;;;;;
23. Don’t be shamed into not buying souvenirs;;;;;;;;;
So many travellers preach that it’s all about experiences not possessions, but you know what? Sometimes possessions can offer beautiful reminders of the experiences you’ve had. I only started buying souvenirs from every country I visited in the last year, and I wish I’d been doing so from the start of my trip. And if you’re worried about space in your backpack, just mail them off to a friend or family once you’ve bought them and your pack will be none the heavier. My friend Jaime collects magnets from every place he visits and I’m so jealous of his collection!;;;;;;;;;
24. The smaller the menu, the better the restaurant;;;;;;;;;
That’s why street food is so delicious! While you’re travelling, look for places that only do a handful of dishes rather than offering 500 options. There’s a better chance of stumbling upon an amazing dish when someone only makes that one single thing all day everyday!;;;;;;;;;
25. Travel in shoulder season to save money and avoid the crowds;;;;;;;;;
Shoulder season is my favourite time to travel. The weather is usually mildest, everything is more affordable than in high season, and there are fewer people visiting, too.;;;;;;;;;

26. Use a VPN;;;;;;;;;
You’ll be connecting to a whole range of unsecured Wi-Fi networks on your trip, so you need to a use a VPN to protect yourself from hackers, malware, and all that good stuff. It’ll also allow you to change your location so you can watch your favourite TV shows online! I pay for a TunnelBear subscription and have been happy with it.;;;;;;;;;
27. Solid Toiletries are the Best;;;;;;;;;
Especially if you want to travel carry-on only. I use a bar of soap instead of shower gel, solid shampoo and conditioner instead of the liquid equivalents, and have even used solid sunscreen and solid insect repellent! LUSH is the best for solid shampoo and conditioner, so make sure you pay them a visit before you leave!;;;;;;;;;
My solid shampoo and conditioner bars are small, lightweight and last me around three months at a time, so they’re great for travellers! Oh, and grab a tin for them as well, so they don’t slime up your toiletries bag.;;;;;;;;;

28. Leaving your comfort zone is the best thing you can do for yourself;;;;;;;;;
I cite leaving my comfort zone as the number one way in which travel has helped me. It was leaving my comfort zone that gave me confidence in my abilities as a traveller. It helped me to overcome my anxiety disorder by showing me the things I was panicking about rarely happened — and if they did, they were never as bad as they thought they would be. And it introduced me to new experiences — most of which I unexpectedly loved!;;;;;;;;;
29. You need a travel towel;;;;;;;;;
I love travel towels so much that I even use mine when I have actual bath towels as an option! Travel towels are quick-drying, incredibly lightweight, and fold up so small! I never travel without mine.;;;;;;;;;
30. But you definitely don’t need a money belt;;;;;;;;;
Money belts are dumb. They’re uncomfortable to wear under your clothes, every time you need to pay for something, it looks like you’re rummaging around in your underwear, and thieves are well aware of their existence. When someone robbed a friend of mine in Brazil, the first thing they did was lift up their top to check for a money belt. Just do whatever you normally do with money at home: put it in your pocket or your purse/wallet.;;;;;;;;;
The Great Wall of China!;;;;;;;;;
31. Go for several test walks with your packed backpack;;;;;;;;;
It’ll likely be much heavier than you think. When I first went for a walk with mine, I went straight home and took out a third of the things I had in it. This will really help you narrow down what are essentials and what you don’t need. I even have a rule when I travel that I try to throw out three things from my backpack every time I travel to a new destination. It sounds like a lot, but I include things like the paracetamol tablets I haven’t taken in nine months or my spare pair of tweezers or the pile of receipts I’ve been lugging around.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
32. Give family and/or friends copies of your itinerary;;;;;;;;;
From a safety perspective, it’s good to have several people back home who know where you’ll be. I forward any flight or accommodation confirmations to my family and Skype with them several times a week to let them know what I’m up to. That way, if ever I disappear for a few days, my family will know immediately and will be able to know where I was staying at that time. It takes just a few minutes but really improves your safety.;;;;;;;;;
33. Don’t change your currency at the airport;;;;;;;;;
That’s where you’ll get the worst exchange rates.;;;;;;;;;
34. If there’s no internet, embrace it;;;;;;;;;
Play a card game with someone in the hostel common room, read a book, lie on the beach, go for a walk, talk to a stranger, think about life. Some of my favourite travel memories are from times when I didn’t have an internet connection to suck me out of the moment.;;;;;;;;;
35. Wear flip-flops in the hostel showers;;;;;;;;;
Imagine several dozen people standing in a shower every single day — keep your feet protected from nasty stuff and wear your flip-flops every time you shower.;;;;;;;;;
At Monument Valley;;;;;;;;;
36. Always, always pack your things the night before your early morning flight;;;;;;;;;
The people I hate most when I travel are those who set their alarm for 4 a.m. and then proceed to spend the next hour packing their bags and rustling what sounds like forty thousand plastic bags. Don’t do this! Pack your bag the night before, so you can slip out without disturbing anyone’s sleep.;;;;;;;;;

37. If an item of clothing can’t survive being worn for five days in a row then being washed in a sink/crappy laundry room, leave it behind;;;;;;;;;
Space will be tight in your backpack, so you’ll want everything to be essential. If your clothes require ironing or will get destroyed easily, don’t pack them. I brought a fancy dress around the world with me and not only did I never wear it (because I was a backpacker and nobody was wearing stuff like that) but I felt guilty about throwing it out, so carried it around with me for an entire year! Don’t do this — bring clothes you don’t care about and replace them for cheap on the road.;;;;;;;;;
38. Start saving early and bring more money than you think you’ll need;;;;;;;;;
It’s good to have a budget to stick to, but most people tend to go over. Start saving as soon as possible (like, now) and aim to bring more money than you think you’ll need. The more money you have, the more you’ll be able to treat yourself to nicer accommodation, splurge on fun tours, and not spend your entire trip worrying that you’ll run out of cash.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
39. Get your phone unlocked before you leave;;;;;;;;;
With an unlocked phone, you’ll be able to buy local SIM cards and access cheap data as you travel. Cheap data means getting to use Google Maps when you’re lost, being able to Snapchat your way around a city, and being easily contactable by your new friends.;;;;;;;;;
40. Don’t be afraid to splurge;;;;;;;;;
It’s necessary every now and then. If you’re feeling exhausted, check yourself into a nice hotel for a few nights. If it’s a special occasion, splash out on a fancy meal. These splurges will mean so much more after months of hanging out in cheap hostels.;;;;;;;;;
Eating duck beaks in Bangkok;;;;;;;;;
41. Open your mind and hold the judgments;;;;;;;;;
If you don’t like a country’s customs, remain open minded, rather than immediately jumping to conclusions that you’re right and it’s wrong. Ask questions, research more, and listen to other peoples’ point of view. And don’t let your bad experiences taint an entire country — if you had a crap time somewhere, it doesn’t mean that the country sucks or it’s not safe. Maybe it was just bad luck.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Don’t judge other travellers, either. Don’t judge people for visiting the most touristy cities in the world, don’t judge them for travelling with a backpack or a suitcase, don’t judge them for being a budget or luxury traveller, don’t judge them for carrying a selfie stick, just accept that everyone’s different, travels for different reasons, and likes different things.;;;;;;;;;
I once met a girl in a hostel in Washington DC who told me that her parents were funding her trip. There I was thinking she was a spoilt brat, until she told me that she was slowly losing her sight and would be blind within a couple of years. Her parents were paying for her to travel the world while she was still able to see it.;;;;;;;;;
42. Invest in a good camera;;;;;;;;;
Your photos will be some of your best memories, so invest in a good camera. And, of course, take the time to understand how it works before you leave.;;;;;;;;;
43. Have a health checkup before you leave;;;;;;;;;
Visit your doctor and dentist for a checkup before you leave. The last thing you want to happen is for you to set off and discover two weeks later that you need to get a filling in India. Not that I’m speaking from experience here…;;;;;;;;;
44. Visit fewer countries so you can work in rest days;;;;;;;;;
So many people email me for advice on their itineraries and I nearly always go back to them recommending that they visit half the number of places. You’ll enjoy your trip more if you work in rest days, and you’ll get a better taste for a place if you spend more time in it. Don’t plan a trip that has you jumping from capital city to capital city every few days. And take account of travel time! Don’t be like two nights in Bangok, two nights in Phuket, two nights in Koh Phi Phi, when it’ll take a day to travel between them all, leaving you with one day to actually see those places. Oh, and you’ll likely be jetlagged, too, so you’ll want to take that into account too.;;;;;;;;;
45. And slow down when you’re in them;;;;;;;;;
If you only have three days in a place, it can be tempting to rush around like a madman to try and see absolutely everything, but that’s just a recipe for a nervous breakdown. Slow down, go to a coffee shop and people watch, wander down alleyways, and chat to locals. Sometimes the best way to get to know a place is through sitting and observing.;;;;;;;;;

46. Keep a journal;;;;;;;;;
You think you won’t forget anything, but you will. You won’t remember the name of that lovely girl from Oslo you hung out with for a day in Marrakech, you won’t remember the name of the hostel you loved in Beijing, you won’t remember the conversation you had with that dude in a pub in Sydney. Keep a journal to remember those small details because you’ll treasure them in a few years.;;;;;;;;;
47. Eat healthier every now and then;;;;;;;;;
Here’s a confession: I gained around 20 pounds over my first few years of travel, mostly thanks to eating out for every single meal. While it can be tempting to treat yourself to junk food, and Pringles and Oreos will fuel your every travel day, resolve to have at least a few days every now and then when you go for the healthier option. Your body and mind will thank you for it. Aim to cut out the rice, bread, and beer to keep your calorie intake low if you’re feeling as though you’re gaining too much weight on the road.;;;;;;;;;

48. Wear your normal clothes;;;;;;;;;
You know those ugly travel-specific clothes? They’re shapeless and made of quick-drying, breathable material, and covered in zips and pockets. Well, they’re great for travel, but you’ll also hate them. You’ll hate every photo of you wearing them. You’ll stand out immediately as a tourist in any place you visit. Instead, just bring the same clothes you’d wear back home. You’ll feel comfortable, you won’t stand out, and you’ll actually like the way you look.;;;;;;;;;
49. Get lost on purpose;;;;;;;;;
Sometimes getting lost is the best way to make awesome discoveries about a place. Sometimes it just plain sucks, that’s true. But if you’ve got a spare day in a place and don’t know what to do, start by picking a random direction and following it.;;;;;;;;;
50. One-way tickets are better than round-the-world;;;;;;;;;
I’m all about travelling on one-way tickets, because they give you the freedom to be spontaneous, change your mind, and extend your trip, if needed. My original itinerary had me heading to Australia after six months, but I ended up going to Thailand instead and stayed for seven months! You can’t get that kind of freedom on a round-the-world ticket. Plus, with so many budget airlines around, one-way tickets don’t have to even be that pricey.;;;;;;;;;
On the beach in Tulum, Mexico;;;;;;;;;
51. Get up early;;;;;;;;;
You see that photo of me on the beach? Half an hour after it was taken, there were at least a hundred people there. I managed to explore the ruins of Tulum on my own and without the crowds simply by being there when it opened. Arrive early for everything and you’ll get to experience major attractions at their least busiest. Plus, sunrises are pretty.;;;;;;;;;

52. The best activities aren’t necessarily traditional tourist ones;;;;;;;;;
Some of my biggest highlights are things that sound so normal: it was drinking and singing with newfound friends in the Philippines, hiking alone in the mountains surrounding Taipei, trying to guess what everything was at a wet market in Saigon, dropping my travel plans to fly home and surprise my mum for her birthday, and spending six weeks in Madrid because that’s where my friends were spending the summer.;;;;;;;;;
53. Scan your important documents and email them to yourself;;;;;;;;;
Scan a copy of your passport, any visas, and any debit/credit cards you’re traveling with. Password protect the documents, and email a copy of them to yourself and to a family member . If everything you own gets stolen, you can access them safely from your email account, take your copies to your embassy as proof that you’re who you say you are. Plus, you’ll be able to buy flights home and pay for accommodation with your debit cards to keep travelling/go home in an emergency.;;;;;;;;;
54. Try travelling alone;;;;;;;;;
I believe that everyone should try solo travel at least once. It builds your confidence, shows you what you’re capable of, improves your social skills, gives you time and space to think, and helps you learn more about what you like and need in life.;;;;;;;;;
55. Use Skyscanner to find cheap flights;;;;;;;;;
I book all of my flights through Skyscanner, because it consistently finds cheapest deals. The key here is to keep things flexible: I look at flights to an entire country (or search for “everywhere” if I’m not sure where to head next) and look at prices over a whole month. I don’t collect points and miles, but I still rarely spend more than $500 on a long-haul flight.;;;;;;;;;

56. Go to the places that interest you most;;;;;;;;;
I’m often emailed by people who are taking a year off to follow the typical backpacking trail: A bit of Western Europe, a lot of Southeast Asia, and a stint in Australia and New Zealand. And yet, they don’t know anything about the places and are asking me what you can even do in Laos.;;;;;;;;;
Don’t follow the beaten path that every traveller takes, just because you feel like you should. What interests you? What do you want to see and learn about? One of the first stops on my trip was Chernobyl — not exactly a popular tourist destination. I didn’t know anybody who had been there, but it sounded fascinating to me. This is your trip: go where excites you, not where you feel you should go.;;;;;;;;;
57. Practice your miming;;;;;;;;;
Traveling in places where you don’t speak the language is surprisingly easy, but get ready to mime a lot. You can mime eating to ask someone if they’re serving food, mime sleeping to ask someone if there are any beds available in the hostel, and I even mimed that I needed to go to a train station by saying, “choo choo!” and drawing a picture of a train in my notepad for a taxi driver in Taiwan!;;;;;;;;;

58. Google Translate’s camera is so incredibly helpful;;;;;;;;;
Download the Google Translate app before you leave and use the camera feature for translating menus, signs, posters, and anything else you need to read. You simply press the camera icon, aim your phone at the text, and it translates it all in real-time for you. This was so unbelievably helpful for menus in Taiwan, where I had no idea what anything was.;;;;;;;;;
59. Travel with a toilet roll;;;;;;;;;
Grab half a roll, squash it up, and keep it in a sandwich bag in your daypack. Long bus journeys in developing countries often stop at squat toilets where there’ll be no toilet paper. At which point, you’ll be unbelievably grateful you have some of your own.;;;;;;;;;
60. And a supply of Imodium;;;;;;;;;
If you’re suffering from food poisoning, it’s best to let it run its course rather than clogging yourself up with Imodium, but there are some situations where it just isn’t possible to do so. I’m talking flights, long bus journeys, booked tours, and anything that requires you to leave the bathroom. A large supply of Imodium is something I always have in my backpack for these emergencies.;;;;;;;;;
Temple hopping in Bagan;;;;;;;;;
61. Use HERE Maps for offline navigation;;;;;;;;;
Don’t have data? You can download entire country maps through HERE Maps and get walking directions for anywhere you need to go. I’ve found it works better than caching Google Maps.;;;;;;;;;

62. Visit the local markets;;;;;;;;;
Local markets are my favourite way to get to know a place better. I love checking out the strange foods, seeing how the locals shop, and discovering what’s popular in a particular country. Night markets in Asia are especially fun!;;;;;;;;;
63. Don’t forget about your friends back home;;;;;;;;;
It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of your travels and forget about the friends you have back home. It happened to me and took a lot of work to repair my friendships. Let people know you’re thinking of them: arrange Skype dates, send postcards, chat on Facebook, and buy them gifts from the places you visit.;;;;;;;;;
64. Say yes to random invitations;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never regretted saying yes to an unexpected invitation, because it’s always led to something fun happening! Make the most of your travel experience by saying yes to more things than you would at home — you’ll discover new things about yourself, meet new people, and build wonderful memories!;;;;;;;;;
65. Be polite and smile often;;;;;;;;;
You’ll be more approachable, you’ll find it easier to make travel friends, and the locals will warm to you. Being rude and looking grumpy will bring nothing good your way.;;;;;;;;;
In paradise: the Cook Islands!;;;;;;;;;
66. Travel slow to save money;;;;;;;;;
The slower you travel, the more money you’ll save. You can negotiate long-term stays at your accommodation to save money, you won’t have any transportation costs, and if you have a kitchen, you can buy food from the supermarket and cook.;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
67. Try turning up without having anything booked;;;;;;;;;
This is the best way to build your travel confidence and is especially easy in Southeast Asia. There are many benefits to it, too: you’ll get to discover cool places that aren’t listed online or in the guidebooks, you’ll be able to look at the rooms before you commit to staying, you can negotiate on price, and you’re not tied to a specific schedule where you need to be somewhere because you’ve booked your accommodation already.;;;;;;;;;
68. Make the most of your layovers;;;;;;;;;
I love getting to explore a new place during a layover, and will almost always extend my travel day so that I can spend three or four days in a new city. Some of my layover highlights from the past five years include 48 hours exploring the Golden Circle in Iceland, spending a few days getting lost in Muscat, and when I spent 24 hours in Abu Dhabi just so I could take photos of the Sheikh Zayed Mosque.;;;;;;;;;
69. Drink more water;;;;;;;;;
You’re probably not drinking enough, especially if you’re traveling through hot, humid countries. If you can drink the tap water, make the most of it and get your two litres of water a day. If not, help the environment by bringing a Steripen along, rather than buying dozens of plastic bottles of water — a Steripen kills more than 99.9% of harmful microorganisms, including giardia, bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, making tap water safe to drink.;;;;;;;;;

70. Pack a Vapur water bottle;;;;;;;;;
Vapur water bottles collapse down so they take up barely any room in your bag, making them perfect for travel.;;;;;;;;;
Paddleboarding in New Zealand;;;;;;;;;
71. Don’t put anything in your back pockets;;;;;;;;;
You’re basically asking to be pickpocketed.;;;;;;;;;
72. McDonald’s and Starbucks nearly always have Wi-Fi;;;;;;;;;
If you need to check emails, get directions, or do anything online, you’ll find a McDonald’s or Starbucks in practically every city around the world. They’re almost guaranteed to have free usable internet.;;;;;;;;;
73. Use a pill bottle instead of blister packs;;;;;;;;;
When I first set out, I had six months’ worth of anti-malarials that took up a ridiculous amount of space in their blister packs. I popped the pills out into a bottle and stuck my prescription onto the outside. It freed up so much room in my bag! Pro tip: stuff some cotton wool into the top so you don’t rattle while you walk.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
74. Mark your luggage so it stands out;;;;;;;;;
You don’t want to accidentally take someone else’s luggage or have someone run off with yours at the baggage reclaim. Stick some stickers on it, put some duct tap along one side, tie some ribbons to the handle — make sure it stands out from a sea of similar backpacks!;;;;;;;;;
75. A power strip will making charging easy;;;;;;;;;
It’s still common to turn up to a dorm room and find you only have a couple of power sockets to share between eight laptop-toting backpackers. Bring a power strip to ensure you can charge what you need to, while allowing everyone else to charge their tech, too.;;;;;;;;;
Drinking buckets in Thailand;;;;;;;;;
76. A dry bag is more useful than you think;;;;;;;;;
Dry bags are amazing for keeping your valuables safe on boat trips and for protecting any electronics you have in your daypack when it starts to rain. I even take mine to the beach when I’m travelling solo so that I can take my stuff in the ocean with me and not have to worry someone’s going to steal everything.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
77. Be skeptical of TripAdvisor reviews;;;;;;;;;
If you’re looking at reviews on TripAdvisor and every five star review is from someone who has only ever left one review, they’re probably fake. Take TripAdvisor reviews with a grain of salt and look at the person who’s leaving the review before you trust them.;;;;;;;;;
78. It’s worth paying to get your laundry done;;;;;;;;;
Washing your clothes in the sink is time-consuming, a pain in the ass, and never very effective. Just pay to have your laundry done instead — it’s worth it.;;;;;;;;;
79. Read up about local customs before you go;;;;;;;;;
You don’t want to offend anyone while you travel, so make sure you’re aware of any offensive gestures or behaviour before you arrive. As an example, in Thailand, women shouldn’t touch monks or hand them anything, you shouldn’t touch the local’s heads, say anything bad about the royal family, use your right hand for passing people things and paying, or point your feet at someone… Do your research!;;;;;;;;;
80. Trust people;;;;;;;;;
Some people will want to take advantage of you, but the vast majority of people you meet when you travel are good, decent, and will want to help you. Don’t let bad experiences prevent you from trusting anyone again. As long as you have your wits about you, expect that tuk-tuk drivers or anyone who comes up to you with amazing English and wants to be your best friend for no reason at all is out to scam you, and be most wary of the people in the most touristy places, you’ll be all good.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
81. Colour coordinate your outfits;;;;;;;;;
You won’t be able to bring many items of clothing with you, so maximise the amount of outfits you can wear by checking everything goes with everything else.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
82. Check your passport’s expiration date;;;;;;;;;
You won’t be able to travel if you have less than six months’ validity on your passport! Friends of mine have been turned around at the airport because they didn’t realise their passport was expiring soon.;;;;;;;;;
83. Charge your devices whenever you have the chance;;;;;;;;;
Whenever you see a spare power socket, charge your tech. You’ll wish you’d taken the opportunity to when you eventually run out of battery. And you’ll always run out of battery;;;;;;;;;
84. Pack a portable battery for your phone;;;;;;;;;
On that note, picking up a tiny, lightweight charger for your phone is a good idea. You can even get ones that fit in your wallet.;;;;;;;;;
85. Protect your technology;;;;;;;;;
I used to be disastrous with my tech, but now that I have cases for everything, I’m doing much better. It’s worth getting a shell for your laptop, a keyboard cover for accidental spills, a sturdy case for your Kindle, and a waterproof case for your phone. Replacing tech is expensive and spending a day trying to figure out which island you need to fly to in the Philippines in order to get your laptop repaired is frustrating.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
86. Pack contraception;;;;;;;;;
You don’t want the biggest souvenir from your trip to be an STD. Or a baby. Pack contraception, have safe sex, and be aware that you can buy birth control pills over the counter in a ton of countries.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
87. Merino is king for cold climates;;;;;;;;;
It’s tough to pack for a trip that’ll take you through warm and cold climates. If you’ll be doing just that, pick up some clothing made of Merino wool. It’ll be lightweight, keep you warm in cold temperatures, cold in hot temperatures, and won’t smell if you wear it for several days in a row.;;;;;;;;;
88. Use an incognito window to book anything;;;;;;;;;
I’ve personally experienced this! If you’re booking flights or accommodation, open an incognito browser window when it’s time to make your booking. I’ve seen prices gradually increase for flights as I kept checking them, only to watch them drop when I used an incognito window.;;;;;;;;;
89. Find photogenic spots with Instagram;;;;;;;;;
Follow local instagrammers in the places you’ll be visiting to find the best spots for taking photos. I also search through hashtags relating to the place I’m heading to to check out the popular photos and see where they were taken.;;;;;;;;;
90. Take a class;;;;;;;;;
Travel is the perfect opportunity to try something new. I loved taking a cooking class in Seoul, a surf lesson in Bali, and both a paddleboarding and fishing lesson in New Zealand. It’s a fun way to learn a new skill while pushing yourself out of your comfort zone!;;;;;;;;;

Surfing in Bali!;;;;;;;;;
91. Make a playlist for memories;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite things to do is create a Spotify playlist for the music I listened to most in each country I visited. Now all I have to do is listen to one and it takes me back to a specific place and time, along with all the emotions I was feeling then.;;;;;;;;;
92. Embrace your nerves;;;;;;;;;
Because they’ll never go away. Those nerves you get the night before leaving? I still experience them, five years on. Whenever I’m visiting a brand new place, I get nervous. Whenever I’m trying something new, I’m nervous. I even get nervous when I’m returning to a place I love! Embrace these travel nerves and accept them as normal — even experienced travellers get them!;;;;;;;;;
93. Lose your inhibitions;;;;;;;;;
The great thing about travel is that nobody knows who you are. If you do something really stupid and embarrassing in a hostel, you can just check out and move to a new place where nobody knows who you are or what your story is. It’s liberating and allows you to actually figure out who you want to be.;;;;;;;;;

94. Take advantage of your youth;;;;;;;;;
If you’re under 25, there are a whole heap of student discounts you can take advantage of. You can get cheaper flights through STA Travel, cheaper train passes through Eurail, free access to museums, and more. Take advantage of your age and check if student discounts are available before booking anything.;;;;;;;;;
95. Practice packing before you leave;;;;;;;;;
Have several trial packing runs before you head off to get the hang of fitting everything into your bag. It’ll help make finding things easier, because unpacking your entire backpack to find something every few days gets old fast.;;;;;;;;;
Temple hunting in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
96. Take into account jetlag and travel fatigue;;;;;;;;;
Let’s say you’re flying straight to Bangkok, where you’ve given yourself three days to see the main attractions. You can plan it all out, but you’ll most likely end up jetlagged and sleeping away a chunk of that time in the city. When you’re planning how long to stay in a place, take jetlag into account, as well as general travel fatigue. Remember you won’t want to be outside exploring for 12 hours a day every single day.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
97. Track your spending;;;;;;;;;
It’s annoying and time-consuming, but you’ll be better off financially if you’re aware of how much money you’re getting through and how it compares to the amount you budgeted for. You can make adjustments if you’re spending too much or allow yourself a small treat if you’re doing better than planned.;;;;;;;;;
98. Accept that you won’t be able to see everything;;;;;;;;;
Nobody will. Even if you travelled every single day for the rest of your life, you’d never see it all. This is a hard lesson to learn, but it makes travel easier on your heart once you accept it.;;;;;;;;;
99. Ask permission when taking photos;;;;;;;;;
How would you feel if some random tourist turned up at your house or work and started taking photos of you? Ask for someone’s permission before you start taking photos of them — it’s the polite and respectful thing to do.;;;;;;;;;
100. Don’t forget how lucky you are;;;;;;;;;
If you can afford to travel, you’re luckier than an enormous chunk of the world’s population. Be grateful that you were born in a country that’s safe and stable. Be grateful you have a passport that allows you to easily travel. Be grateful that you have your health. Be grateful you were able to get a job; that you had the ability to save up enough money to travel. Yes, you worked goddamn hard to get to this point, but you’re still unbelievably privileged. Never forget it.;;;;;;;;

Here’s what I’ve been up to over the past four weeks!";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I kicked off this month in Taipei, thrilled to be still and with some semblance of balance. I was spending my mornings working in coffee shops, my lunches hunting down the best budget eats in the city, my afternoons hiking, and my evenings wandering through our local night market. I can’t tell you how refreshing it was to be able to settle into a routine for more than a few days!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re feeling hungry, brace yourself, because this update is going to be all about the food. First up, Taipei!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite lunchtime discoveries in the city was Ramen Sanji, where I rarely strayed from their delicious pork tsukemen. Tsukemen is a dipping noodle version of Japanese ramen, where all of the ingredients are served separate. There’s the salty reduced broth, the noodles, a garlic miso soup, and a side dish full of ingredients to add. My favourite? The big slab of fatty pork. I must have eaten here at least half a dozen times while I was in Taipei.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To my surprise, my Taipei trip ended up being all about the Japanese food (side note: why I haven’t I visited Japan yet?!) and the runner-up restaurant has to be Sekijin, which was all about the fried everything. This set meal of salmon and shrimp was my favourite dish.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of the things I loved most about the Xinyi neighbourhood was how easy it was to find excellent international food. There was a Canadian restaurant just a few blocks away from our apartment, which was perfect for grabbing Moosehead lager and a delicious bowl of poutine to celebrate the end of another work day. My favourite flavour was the beef, bacon, and melted cheese!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Silky smooth mango shaved ice from Ice Monster. You can’t visit Taipei without coming here!;;;;;;;;;
From Taipei, I flew to Melbourne, where I set about having the most indulgent couple weeks of my life. With two weeks spent living in the hipster Fitzroy neighbourhood, Dave and I spent our entire time splurging on incredible food!;;;;;;;;;

New experience time! This month, I rode on the back of an enormous motorbike for the first time! Racing through the streets of Melbourne was an exhilarating experience that was so much more enjoyable than a scooter, and I can’t wait to do it again.;;;;;;;;;

One of my favourite moments was a date night at Nyala, a kickass African restaurant on Brunswick street. It was one of those evenings where everything fell perfectly into place: watching the sunset over the city with a warm breeze blowing in through the window, ordering one of everything on the menu and falling in love with so many new dishes, great wine, and even better company. Walking back to our apartment afterwards, I realised my jaw was aching from smiling so much and I couldn’t remember the last time I’d felt so happy.;;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Catching a terrible cold a week before flying out of Taipei. I’d saved tons of fun activities for that final week — taking the elevator to the top of Taipei 101, visiting the Friends-themed cafe, and heading to the city’s museums — but ended up spending the week in bed instead. Still, it gives me an excuse to return in the future!;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I can’t believe I forgot to apply for my Australian visa for the second time in a row! It was 12 hours before my flight when I discover I hadn’t applied for it, and what followed was a sleepless night spent panicking I was going to have to spend Christmas alone in Manila. Despite my friends’ assurances that the visa would be approved immediately, I made my way to the airport without a confirmation.;;;;;;;;;
I was allowed on to the flight to Manila, where I would have six hours to try and figure out how to get my visa. The eVisitor visa takes 8-10 business days to be approved, and UK citizens can’t apply for an ETA online, leaving me with very few options.;;;;;;;;;
I found a suitably shady website called EasyETA, Paypal’d them $60, and wondered if that was one of the stupidest things I’ve ever done.;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t. My visa came through within 20 minutes, and then I was on my way to Melbourne!;;;;;;;;;
Instagram of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I’m focusing on improving my Instagram account this year, and I’m excited to share my progress in my summaries! This month, my most popular photo came from sunset at Angkor Wat, which rocked up 286 likes.;;;;;;;;;

We spent our month in Taipei in this loft-style apartment with one of the best views I’ve ever had. We were based in the heart of the Xinyi district, a few minutes’ walk away from Taipei 101, surrounded by dozens of cafes and restaurants, and my favourite night market in the city: Tonghua! This is one of my favourite Airbnb apartments I’ve stayed in so far.;;;;;;;;;

My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
After another couple of weeks spent eating exploring Melbourne, I’ll be jetting off to New Zealand to spend two weeks hanging out with Dave’s family. This trip will be the exact opposite of my previous visit, filled with few tourist attractions and little moving around. We’ll be basing ourselves in Hanmer Springs, a small alpine village that’s popular with locals, thanks to its many hikes and hot springs, and I’m looking forward to starting the year with decompression and stillness.;;;;;;;;;
One week into the new year, however, I’ll be setting off again, this time for some solo travel while Dave stays in New Zealand. First up: the Cook Islands! I’ll be spending a fully week hopping between the islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki on a budget, and I can’t tell you how excited I am. Aitutaki looks like paradise!;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next on my island hopping jaunt is beautiful French Polynesia, where I’ll be kicking off my travels with a visit to Tahiti, then onwards to Maupiti — a tiny island that’s said to be what Bora Bora was like fifty years ago. Oh, and Bora Bora? Yep, I’ll be going there, too, and yep, I’m going to be doing my entire trip on a budget! I can’t wait to share how you can visit paradise on the cheap.;;;;;;;;;

Here’s what we were looking for:";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Somewhere warm: After spending several years chasing summer around the world, the idea of a cold and rainy winter wasn’t appealing. It’s hard to find anywhere with temperatures in the double figures in Europe over January, even in the countries in the south. Granada, in the south of Spain, had some of the warmest temperatures and, most importantly, very little rain. Thanks to its position at the base of the Sierra Nevada, bright blue skies feature in Granada year-round and this was one of our swaying factors.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Somewhere affordable: Spain is one of the cheapest countries in Western Europe, and our research found Granada to be highly affordable.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Somewhere with good food: Tapas! While Spanish food isn’t known for having much spice, I could put up with that if my life would contain an abundance of jamon y queso. Granada’s close proximity to Morocco also means that cheap kebabs and Middle Eastern food are within easy access.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Somewhere where we could communicate: I studied Spanish at school for the better part of a decade — although have forgotten lots of it — and the six months Dave and I spent in Mexico gave us enough functional Spanish to get around. We would find it far easier to assimilate into a country where we could speak a small amount of the language over our alternative options of Portugal, Italy, and Greece, where I don’t know little more than a single word.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Other factors that were appealing included: good transport links to the rest of Spain, having friends in the city (probably the most important factor for extrovert Dave, as spending three months without other people around drives him insane), and the beautiful Alhambra – we love staying in pretty cities!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

We stayed in Granada for three months, so in order to calculate the cost per month, I took my total expenses and found the average.;;;;;;;;;

Views of Granada from the Alhambra. Our apartment was on that small hill to the right!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We were staying in a gorgeous three-floor, two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the vibrant Albaycin neighbourhood of Granada. It’s the Islamic Quarter of the city, full of whitewashed buildings, bustling markets, shisha bars, and Middle Eastern restaurants, in the tumbling alleyways of the hills of Granada. It’s slightly outside of the centre and therefore cheaper, but nowhere we needed to go was more than a 15-minute walk away.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our apartment had plentiful hot water, a well-equipped kitchen, and spacious second bedroom for guests to stay. Our living room came complete with a large desk for working and a balcony overlooking the street below. I appreciated having wooden shutters in the bedroom that blocked out all light in the mornings.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our Wi-Fi was fast but temperamental (resetting the router solved all problems) and we were within walking distance of most of the city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We found our apartment through Airbnb — here’s the link to the apartment — which meant that we were paying roughly three times more than a local would. Given that our Spanish wasn’t great, and very few people speak English in Granada, we were wary of just turning up and finding a place when we arrived. Additionally, I needed to have started writing my book four months ago, so didn’t have the time to wander the streets looking for the perfect place.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For comparison, some friends of ours are staying on the outskirts of Granada and are paying 450 euros a month (plus bills) for a 4-bedroom place.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If we were going to spent another stint in Granada, we would likely turn up and look for apartments once we arrived to get a better deal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Transportation;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Granada is an incredibly walkable city and we could get anywhere on foot. We didn’t take a single bus for the three months we lived there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food (Eating Out);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Eating out in Granada is probably more affordable than eating at home, thanks to the mind-blowing tapas culture. Throughout the city, you can walk into practically any bar, order a drink, and receive a free plate of food! Dave and I would often head out for lunch, order a couple of glasses on wine each, receive a few plates of food for free, and head home tipsy, full, and three euros lighter. Yes, that’s three euros total for four glasses of wine and two plates of food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tapas are small-ish plates of pretty much anything you can think of — fried fish, chicken and rice, jamon and cheese sandwiches, paella, and more! Each plate of food you receive is different and it’s common for the size and quality of the dish to increase as you order more drinks, encouraging you to stay at the same bar rather than hopping around. We often visited the same restaurant (Restaurante Manolo) and after the staff recognised us, they started giving us extra plates of food when we visited.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Some of our free tapas!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Menú del días are a great way to keep your costs down and receive fantastic value for money, especially if you have a large appetite. For 7 euros or so, you can grab a 3-5 course meal at a restaurant.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When you’re not sampling the free tapas, head to Bodega Castaneda for some of the best meat and cheese plates I’ve ever had; €10 for that plate below:;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We ate quite a bit of Middle Eastern food while we were in Granada, where you could head out and pick up a kebab, French fries, and a soft drink for $5.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food (eating at home);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was working hard on my book, so didn’t have as much time to eat out as I normally do. Thankfully, we had a pretty good kitchen so getting food wasn’t a big deal. We lived ten minutes from a Mercadona, and visited twice a week to pick up everything we needed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We weren’t cooking in Granada, so opted to pick up several baguettes, cheeses, jamon, pate, wine, fruit, jalapenos, and pickles. Each visit typically came in at around €40.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Buying alcohol in Granada is incredibly cheap, and the best wine is priced at €1-3 a bottle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Activities;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Many of the best activities in Granada are free. There are dozens of hikes you can venture out on in the mountains, and wandering around the picturesque city is an activity in itself.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Everyone who visits Granada hits up the Alhambra, which comes in at a cost of around $16 per person. I recommend buying a ticket several weeks in advance from Ticketmaster, and getting one for the earliest time slot in the day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of the highlights from our time in Granada was a 21-course tasting meal at La Oliva. In a small restaurant that seats a maximum of six, Franisco cooks up a tasting meal based around local produce. Every single ingredient comes from Granada or nearby villages. At €41 a person for 21 courses of food, it was exceptional value!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Getting Connected;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I buy a local SIM card in every country I visit these days to make my visit as hassle-free as possible. It means that I can use Google Maps to find my way back home, that I can Instagram and tweet my way around a city, and I can get in touch with Dave if I need to.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting a SIM card in Granada was fairly straightforward and for €15, I received 1.2GB of data, 60 minutes of calls and 60 texts. Too Many Adapters has a comprehensive guide to buying a local SIM card in Spain.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Miscellaneous;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I bought a juicer from Amazon to take advantage of the delicious fruits in Granada. I paid $40.59 for the Philips HR2100 blender.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Replacing broke cups and plates (of course! I’m accident-prone!) came in at €7.30;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Souvenirs. While I try not to buy souvenirs as I travel as I don’t often have room in my backpack, I’ve found jewellery to be the perfect way to remind myself of a place without adding much weight or space to my pack. In Granada, I picked up a couple of pairs of earrings for around €10.;;;;;;;;;

Overall, Granada makes a cheap place to base yourself for a few months.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re looking for a place with fantastic weather (we had two days of snow and one day of rain in three months over winter! I think we may have had three cloudy days), delicious, cheap food, affordable living, and easy access to southern Spain, take a look at Granada! ;;;;;;;;;

I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about putting up my personal goals for public consumption (and judgment) last year, especially as one of my aims for 2016 was to start sprinkling a little more privacy into my online life. But to my great surprise, I really freaking loved putting my goals out into the world.;;;;;;;;;
It kept me accountable. It kept me focused. And yeah, knowing that some readers had told me I was being too ambitious and wouldn’t be able to do it made me put in a hell of a lot more effort.;;;;;;;;;
I loved having trackable goals for my year, and I feel happier and stronger for achieving so much — most likely more than I otherwise would.;;;;;;;;;
Have you checked out my post about how I did with my 2016 goals yet? If not, bounce on over there and take a look.;;;;;;;;;
I’m determined to make 2017 my best year on planet earth, and I have tons of goals in mind to help me get there. Many of these focus on furthering on my 2016 goals, and some are 2016 goals rolled over because I wish I’d been able to achieve them.;;;;;;;;;
As gaways, my goals are S.M.A.R.T., because making vague aims to lose weight or eat better don’t work for me. I need numbers to aim for to help me track my progress or I just get lazy. S.M.A.R.T. for me is:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
S – specific;;;;;;;;;
M – measurable;;;;;;;;;
A – attainable;;;;;;;;;
R – rewarding;;;;;;;;;
T – time-bound;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This will most likely be a long post, so grab a glass of port and settle in for the ride.;;;;;;;;;
My 2017 Travel Goals;;;;;;;;;
If you thought that me stopping travelling full-time would mean a reduction in the amount of travelling I do, you’re wrong! These days, my wanderlust is back in full force and I can’t seem to stop booking flights and dreaming about faraway destinations. These are my five travel goals for 2017.;;;;;;;;;
Morocco is the only African country I’ve been to. I have plans to change that in 2017!;;;;;;;;;
To Explore Seven New Countries in Africa;;;;;;;;;
Africa is a big blank space in my travel map and I’m aiming to start changing this in 2017.;;;;;;;;;

In 2017, I want to kickstart my African explorations by visiting seven new countries on the continent. I’ll be heading to Mozambique in just five days[!], travelling solo and overland through Swaziland and across South Africa to Cape Town, and then heading into Namibia for a big road trip with Dave in March.;;;;;;;;;
As for the other three countries on my list, I have no idea what they could be. I’m keen to check out Cape Verde, as well as Sao Tome and Principe. Sierra Leone and Ghana are high on my West Africa wishlist. Djibouti is a place I’ve recently become obsessed with and Botswana sounds amaaazing. As does Gabon and Ethiopia and Zambia and Malawi and Zimbabwe and Uganda and Madagascar. And Mauritius is somewhere I’ve had high on my list ever since I cancelled my trip there a couple of years ago. Argh!;;;;;;;;;
Let’s just say I’m not stuck for ideas right now.;;;;;;;;;
To Take My First Steps in South America;;;;;;;;;
Just like the African continent, South America is a black hole in my universe. I’m determined to take my first steps on my sixth continent this year and I’m open to pretty much anywhere. Because I want to go everywhere! Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Suriname… Swoon. They all sound amazing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How will I decide? Most likely I’ll keep monitoring cheap flights from Europe to South America and if one pops up that works for me, I’ll jump on it!;;;;;;;;;
I’m excited to see which country I end up choosing.;;;;;;;;;
To Explore More of Portugal;;;;;;;;;
The longer I spend in Portugal, the more I fall in love with it. I’m going to make a real concerted effort to see as much of the country as possible in 2017.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve already booked a week in Porto in May, which I’ll be using as a base to explore some northern Portugal cities I’ve had on my radar for a while, and I’d like to check out the Algarve away from the Little Britain tourist hellholes as well.;;;;;;;;;
I’m also hoping to take a trip to both Madeira and the Azores this year, as both look stunning.;;;;;;;;;
To Finally Make it to Two of my Asian Oversights;;;;;;;;;
There are two major countries in Asia I feel I really should have been to by now, so 2017’s the year to make it happen.;;;;;;;;;
First, India. I’ve made and cancelled so many trips to India that it’s no longer funny. So this year, I’m hoping to take a solo trip to India and hope that I don’t die while doing so. It’ll most likely be an open-ended trip, as I really don’t know how I’ll feel about the country. Part of me thinks you can only do it justice if you plan out a three-month-long trip as a minimum; the other part of me is worried I’ll get dysentery, hate every second, and want to fly home immediately. Because I’ll also be working on reducing stress this year, if it’s too much for me, I won’t be ashamed to go home and try again another time.;;;;;;;;
Second on my list of oversights is Japan! I’ve been crazy-obsessed with the idea of going to Japan for years now, but always ended up cancelling tentative plans due to the costs. Japan is pretty expensive to travel through. Well, this year, I’m planning on finally getting there and I couldn’t be more excited. I’ll most likely hit it up in November, when Dave and I will be flying to Australia/New Zealand for Christmas. It’s a logical stopover for us and one that will be fulfilling a long-held travel dream.;;;;;;;;;
To Visit My Remaining Countries in Europe;;;;;;;;;
I loved spending my 2016 summer jumping around Europe, so I’ve decided to do exactly the same this year. While last year focused on my oversights, this year will focus on the countries I have left to visit.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This is totally a stretch goal, because I still have a lot to check out: Albania, Belarus, Denmark, Ireland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, and San Marino.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll most likely aim to spend my summer out east, hitting up Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Moldova, with a trip to Belarus tacked on to the end. Dave and I are also planning for taking an offline summer vacation to Malta, and I may be able to squeeze the others in on random weeks or fortnights throughout the year. Liechtenstein and San Marino will be a pain in the ass, but Denmark and Ireland should be easy enough.;;;;;;;;;
A Gym for monks (maybe) in Phrae, Thailand.;;;;;;;;;
My Fitness Goals for 2017;;;;;;;;;
My fitness was one of the areas I failed with in 2016, so I’d like to give it a renewed focus in 2017. I’ll still keep up with my gym membership and aim to visit four times a week while I’m not travelling.;;;;;;;;;
To Be Able to Do 100 Push Ups;;;;;;;;;
This was my goal in 2016, and I fell short by just 14. I’d love to finally get to be able to doing 100 push ups without stopping by the end of 2017. I’m convinced I’ll be able to easily do this if I can find the motivation to do them in hotel rooms as I travel around the world.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To Be Able to Do the Splits;;;;;;;;;
Yep! It wouldn’t be a Lauren list of goals if this wasn’t in there! I’m fairly confident I’ll be able to get here if I stay focused on it, but I’ve said that for 15 years and counting now.;;;;;;;;;
To Be Able to Do Five Pull Ups;;;;;;;;;
Eeeep! I hate pull ups. At the moment, I can do maybe 10% of one. But I want to continue with my strength training this year, and pull ups are such a basic and important part of that. I know I’ll be able to get there with this one if I can get over myself and learn to march proudly up to the pull up machine at the gym and feel no shame about my puny attempts. Oh, and also get a trainer to show me how to do actually do a pull up.;;;;;;;;;
To Do Blogilates Five Times a Week;;;;;;;;;
I’ve got a whole lot of nostalgia stirred in with this goal. Back when I was living in a hippie beach town in Mexico for three months, I got hooked on Blogilates videos and did them religiously for the better part of a year. And it made me feel so good! I love Cassie’s fun personality, challenging routines, and the sheer variety of videos there are to choose from. I also love that it’s easy to do the routines while travelling.;;;;;;;;;
I used to walk around Sayulita with a spring in my step and a weight off my shoulders, and it was all because pilates did wonderful things for my body. I’ve missed feeling like that and would love to get it back.;;;;;;;;;
I stopped doing the videos regularly after getting mono, and although I’ve kept trying to start back up, I’ve never been able to build up the momentum to keep going for more than a month.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;

My Health/Personal Development Goals for 2017;;;;;;;;;
2016 was the year that I took greater control of my health. I did the Whole30, I got a ton of blood work done, I saw a naturopathic doctor, I meditated everyday, I learned to cook, and I now have a lifestyle that makes me feel strong, happy and healthy. This was a real focus of mine in 2016 and I’m excited to take it further this year and get myself feeling the best I ever have.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
To Become Reasonably Conversational in Portuguese;;;;;;;;;
Yep! This year, a huge focus of mine is to learn to speak Portuguese. A few friends of mine in Lisbon have found a teacher they like who offers one-on-one classes for just 90 euros for five sessions, which sounds pretty perfect to me. I know I’d be way more confident and ask more questions in a one-on-one situation than in a group situation, which would just make me uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll be travelling a lot this year, and I know that consistency is key, so I’m not going to make this too challenging for myself. By the end of 2017, I’d like to have passed the A1 and A2 CEFR exams in Portuguese.;;;;;;;;;
To do a Silent Vipassana Retreat;;;;;;;;;
I fell in love with meditation this year, and plan on keeping up my average of five times a week in 2017. It had so many benefits for me!;;;;;;;;;
I also want to further my practice this year by doing a silent vipassana retreat. I’ve had so many friends do it and come out saying it was both the worst and best thing they’ve ever done, which has me intrigued to give it a go. I highly doubt the silence aspect will be a problem for me as an introvert — it actually sounds amazing, ha — but the sitting still and meditating for ten hours a day with only my crazy-ass mind to keep me company? I know it’s going to be tough.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Will I be an absolute eye-rolling cliche and do the retreat while I’m in India? Maybe!;;;;;;;;;
Keep a Journal for an Entire Year;;;;;;;;;
One of my greatest regrets from over five years of travel is that I didn’t keep a diary. At the time, I told myself it was fine because I had this blog to keep track of what I’ve done, but this blog doesn’t keep track of everything. In fact, I probably only record about 20% of my travels here, because most of it is mundane. But it’s the mundane stuff I wish I’d remembered. The people I’ve met and their names and the conversations we had and the times I got lost trying to find my hostels and the times I cried and the things that made me scared. I’m sad I can’t look back and read a diary of the thoughts and experiences that haven’t been polished for public consumption.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve bought a journal and I plan to write in it almost every day this year.;;;;;;;;;
I’m one of those people who have started diaries like, once a month sometimes, but as soon as I missed a day, I would stop writing in it and tell myself I needed to start a new one. Which I know is really weird. Hopefully that won’t happen this year.;;;;;;;;;
Wake Up Early Every Day for 30 Days;;;;;;;;;
I thought about doing another whole30, but I eat paleo most of the time anyway these days and still reap many positive effects.;;;;;;;;;
So it’s time for another 30 day challenge!;;;;;;;;;
One challenge I’ve been seeing online a lot recently is a challenge to wake up early every day for a month. I love being awake early in the morning! I’m most productive when I wake up and it’s still dark and silent outside. But I’m lazy and sleeping with someone else means I always choose cuddles over blog posts and stay in bed until 9 am every day.;;;;;;;;;
In 2017, I’m going to set myself a challenge to wake up at either 4 am or 5 am every single morning to see what effect it has on me. Will it make me cranky and angry? Will I waste every afternoon to napping? Will I punch Dave in the face? Will it be amazing and fill me with energy and mean I can get more done? I like this challenge because I can do it while I’m travelling too.;;;;;;;;;
Drink More Water;;;;;;;;;
Oh man, I’m lazy about this. But water is everything. I bullet journal my life these days, so I keep track of water intake every single day, because it’s important to me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After getting my blood work done, I learned that the ideal amount of water for me consume per day is 1.5 litres. I’m going to try to meet that goal an average of five times a week for the entire year. I’ll use the habit tracker in my bullet journal to track how much I drink and tally it up at the end of the year.;;;;;;;;;
This should be pretty easy to keep up with while I travel too. I travel with a Grayl water purifier bottle that kills 99.999% of all viruses, bacteria, and cysts in water, making it completely safe to drink. You can drink tap water anywhere in the world with this kickass bottle!;;;;;;;;;
Working not working in Seattle;;;;;;;;;
My Work Goals for 2017;;;;;;;;;
I was far too ambitious with my work goals in 2016, so I’m keeping them simple for 2017. Mostly.;;;;;;;;;
To Release My First Course;;;;;;;;;
I’m so excited about this! I want to focus on building more products for my site, and first up is a course on overcoming your fears to travel. I must get five emails a day from people who suffer from anxiety but dream of travelling, so I don’t know why it took me this long to get my ass in gear and realise this is what people want from me! I hope to have my course live in April, and I really hope it does well.;;;;;;;;;

To Up My Social Media Presence;;;;;;;;;
I’m pretty good at social media and usually get an above-average level engagement, but for some reason, I’ve never been a regular poster anywhere but Twitter. I’m lazy, I forget about it. And I’m worried my posts will make people unfollow me, so instead I don’t post anything at all. Which is riddonk.;;;;;;;;;
In 2017, I’m going to try to average five posts a week on my Facebook page and five photos a week on Instagram. I think my average at the moment is probably one.;;;;;;;;;
To Double My Traffic;;;;;;;;;
Pre-book deal, there was a group of around ten travel bloggers that I knew were at a similar level of traffic to me. When I took a year out to work on getting a publishing deal and write the book, then another year out to recover from writing it, I was left behind in their wake. And yes, I know that comparison is the thief of joy, but I still do it nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;
How do I plan to get there? By hiring someone to improve my Pinterest game and by continuing to write lots of detailed resources that will rank well in Google.;;;;;;;;;
To Start Publishing a Series of Travel Guides;;;;;;;;;
I’ve always wanted to have a series of detailed travel guides to the countries I’ve been to on this site, but been put off by the sheer amount of work involved in writing down every single thing I know about a place. I’ll be aiming to get six of these published this year, which means one every couple of months. I’ll most likely start with Mozambique, as I’ve personally struggled to find much information about it and will be travelling fairly extensively across the country.;;;;;;;;;
To Write One Guest Post a Month;;;;;;;;;
Last year, I set myself a goal to get my writing published in twenty different publications. I managed just one and that was an article I’d pitched back in 2015.;;;;;;;;;
This year, I’d like to keep this goal but cut it down to one guest post a month. I’m in the process of finishing off my first one for January, so I’m already on track with this. Fingers crossed I don’t let my Imposter Syndrome creep back into my life and prevent me from hitting this one!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
I’m all about challenges. But not eating this hot dog, because I think it ended up giving me food poisoning.;;;;;;;;;
And that’s it for my goals for 2017! I’m so excited for this brand new year and can’t wait to get back to conquering the world again. While I think I’ve set myself some pretty ambitious goals, I know I’ll be able to hit the vast majority of them if I stay focused and don’t get all infected like I did last year.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
"What goals have you set yourself for 2017?""";;;;;;;;;

At the start of the month, I crossed my fingers and signed a year-long lease on what I hoped would be my perfect apartment. I collected my keys, moved in, and suddenly had a whole lot of domestic chores for the first time in a very long time.;;;;;;;;;
Long-term travel is great for avoiding the mundane parts of life. You never have to stress about those everyday things, like tidying the house, taking the trash out, and cleaning the toilet. I hadn’t had to worry about power bills and paying for putting the A/C or heating on. I hadn’t had to worry about buying new furniture. Or defrosting the freezer. Or what to do when you suddenly spot water dripping down through your ceiling.;;;;;;;;;
I feel like I should say this brought my crashing back down to earth, but it was all such a novelty that I loved every second of it.;;;;;;;;;
Just like when I first started travelling, everything felt new and exciting to me.;;;;;;;;;
Even a four-hour trip to IKEA.;;;;;;;;;
Even an entire day spent putting together IKEA furniture and using a flip-flop as a hammer.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave was finally able to buy the standing desk he’d been craving trying out for a while, along with a monitor so that he can work more efficiently. I bagged our second bedroom as a sanctuary and spent the month kitting it out with candles, beanbags, oil diffusers, colouring books, rugs, maps of the world, cushions, blankets, and more. I’d been dreaming of this sanctuary for over a year — it had been the only thing to halt my panic attacks while I’d been travelling — so I was determined to bring my vision of it to life.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I joined a gym, too, and bought a year-long membership — another novelty as, aside from a couple of months in Chiang Mai, I hadn’t had access to a gym in five years. I bought recipe books for my kitchen. And I bought appliances. And I even picked up some loyalty cards for my new favourite restaurants and cafes in town.;;;;;;;;;
And I bought clothes! For the first time in five years, I could justify buying a coat and not having to throw it away the moment I needed to get on a plane. I could own more than two pairs of shorts; more than a pair of jeans, more than one dress. I could have shoes that weren’t flip-flops or hiking boots.;;;;;;;;
It all sounds so terribly domestic — most likely even terribly boring — but nothing brought me more joy than settling into a routine and starting to create a more stable life.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of course, I couldn’t spend an entire month just buying furniture and putting it together, so I made sure to take plenty of day trips from my new base.;;;;;;;;;
With these early summer months bringing warm temperatures and clear blue skies, I took full advantage of being in a city with a beach and hopped on many trams and trains out to different spots along the coastline to check some of them out.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cascais is probably the most well-known beach in Lisbon, and, hmmm, well, after a winter in the South Pacific along with a week in Miami last month, I wasn’t blown away by the beach.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And yes, the water was freezing.;;;;;;;;;
But it was a beach and it was now our local one, so I loved it nonetheless. And let’s face it: for a city beach, it was pretty damn great.;;;;;;;;;
We also took the time to head further afield to search out some quieter beaches for when the summer crowds descend upon the city. Praia da Arriba was my favourite of the bunch we visited, and Praia da Cresmina was great for kiteboarding, but far too windy for sunbathing.;;;;;;;;;
It was my birthday this month! And how great to get to celebrate it in my new home! Dave bought me cupcakes and so many thoughtful presents (now that I have a base and an address, I could ask for physical things for the first time!), we spent the day at the beach in Cascais, and he took me out to dinner to my favourite restaurant in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
With not even a full month in our apartment, we were on a plane again — this time jetting off to see travel blogging friends Pete and Dalene in Girona. They’d invited us to come hang out with them in their apartment for a few days, which we, of course, accepted.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Girona is somewhere that’s been written about extensively on travel blogs, so I was excited to finally get to see it for myself, especially with friends who knew the place so well.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our first day in town was spent wandering around the pretty alleyways, snapping photos of the views from the city walls, and drinking many, many gin and tonics.;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Not really a specific event this month, but a feeling.;;;;;;;;;
A feeling of comfort and happiness and relaxation. A feeling of control. A feeling of being exactly where I need to be.;;;;;;;;;
A feeling that hitting the pause button and moving to Lisbon was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.;;;;;;;;;
Guys, I’m so happy here! :-);;;;;;;;;

Getting salmonella in Girona!;;;;;;;;;
I woke up on my second morning in town at about 4 a.m., overcome with nausea. I then proceeded to spend the next three hours in the bathroom trying to throw up as quietly as possible, so that I didn’t wake everyone up. Not only to be polite and respectful, but also because this was so embarrassing and gross.;;;;;;;;;
I felt terrible and I couldn’t even lie down to sleep, because I’d have to run to throw up as soon as I did. Instead, I had to spend all day with my head in my hands, trying to sleep sitting upright, but mostly failing.;;;;;;;;;
There’s something truly awful about being so sick while you’re staying in someone else’s apartment that only has one bathroom.;;;;;;;;;
Plus: I was gutted to be in such a beautiful place with friends and having to spend almost all of it either in bed or in the bathroom. Ugh.;;;;;;;;;
Then having to take the flight back to Lisbon with zero energy and intense nausea was awful. I barely ate anything for the next week, even when I was home!;;;;;;;;;
The Best Thing I Ate: ;;;;;;;;;
It has to be the birthday cupcakes Dave surprised me with from Tease, the cupcake shop in Lisbon that makes the best ones I’ve ever had!;;;;;;;;;
The ones he picked out for me were white chocolate strawberry cheesecake with a shortbread heart; vanilla red velvet; chocolate lime; and chocolate mint with an After Eight on top. I may have eaten them all on my birthday, and I may have had two for breakfast.;;;;;;

And when we stopped at a restaurant in Girona for lunch one day and I saw they had a half-metre hot dog on the menu, I, of course, ordered it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The only problem was: I don’t really like hot dogs very much.;;;;;;;;;
Yep, I totally ordered this dish just so that I could take photos with it.;;;;;;;;;

My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
All of the touristy things in Lisbon! My parents are coming to town for a long weekend, so I’ve been saving up all of the tourist attractions to do for when they arrive. I’ll be trying to cram in as much as possible while they’re here, from visiting the castle, to riding historic trains, to hunting down the best pasteis de nata in the city.;;;;;;;;;

I mean, just look at this:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That’s Bora Bora and it was even more spectacular than I’d dreamed it would be.;;;;;;;;;
But you know what? It was actually the islands outside of Bora Bora that captured my heart and that was a big surprise. I visited five of them over my two weeks in French Polynesia and I was thrilled to discover how much each individual island had to offer travellers — and they were all so different! I spent my time hiking volcanoes, spotting manta rays, learning how to crack open coconuts, swimming in lagoons, feeding sacred blue-eyed eels, and sunbathing on some of the best beaches I’ve ever seen.;;;;;;;;;
French Polynesia was nothing like I’d expected. In some respects, island-hopping my way around was far easier than I’d thought it would be, but in others, it was frustratingly hard. More on that in the post.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s what it’s like to travel in French Polynesia:;;;;;;;;;

Arriving is Incredibly Easy if You’re From the EU;;;;;;;;;
French Polynesia is, obviously, a French territory, so arriving was just as simple for me as it is to travel inside the EU. I know this really shouldn’t have been a surprise, but it was just so easy! At the airport, I was first off the plane and ambushed by two singing ukulele players along with a girl in a grass skirt. They performed a Polynesian dance for everyone as we trundled past them. I felt as far away from Europe as I could possibly get. ;;;;;;;;;

Click here to see an Air Tahiti map of French Polynesia overlaid across Europe — they’re essentially the same size. That’s a whole lot of islands, a whole lot of distance, and a whole lot of ocean!;;;;;;;;;
When I first started planning my French Polynesia jaunt, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of islands I could visit. How could I possibly choose just a few?;;;;;;;;;
There’s the Society Islands, just to the west of Tahiti. They attract the most number of tourists, thanks to Bora Bora, and they were ultimately where I decided to spend all of my time. Even when dedicating two weeks to this group of islands, I only managed to get to a third of them. And I was moving fast.;;;;;;;;;
What did I skip over? The Tuamotos, a string of 80 atolls stretching roughly over the size of Western Europe. These are all low islands: sand bars atop coral reefs and look ridiculously beautiful. There’s the Marquesas, one of the most remote island groups in the world, 900 miles and a 3.5 hour flight from Tahiti. Unlike the Tuamotos, these are mostly tall, volcanic islands, and unlike most of French Polynesia, aren’t surrounded by coral reefs. Finally, there’s the lesser-visited Gambier Islands, which consist of 14 volcanic islands inside a large lagoon, and the Austral Islands, quiet islands with a few guesthouses and (supposedly) the most authentic Polynesian culture.;;;;;;;;;

Guys, I want to go to them all. Reading through that list has me feeling as though I could easily spend three months in French Polynesia and still leave having seen so little of it. Which gives me many, many reasons to return!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Try to Travel as Slowly as Possible;;;;;;;;;
I know, right? There I am, talking about how I want to visit as many islands as possible, and the next minute I’m saying to slow down.;;;;;;;;;
Island time is real and in French Polynesia, it’s especially present. This is a place where everything happens slowly. It’s where the locals ride bicycles and sing out bonjour! to everyone who passes, no matter their nationality. It’s a place to unwind and meditate; to smell the flowers and laze in turquoise lagoons.;;;;;;;;
One of my biggest regrets was moving so fast during my two weeks that I didn’t get to properly embrace that way of life. I’d arrive at one guesthouse and be leaving for a new island three days later.;;;;;;;;;
If I could do it again, I’d have cut out Raiatea (it was too big to explore on foot) and spent my two weeks in Maupiti, Huahine, and Bora Bora. Three islands (plus a night or two in Tahiti) over two weeks sounds perfect.;;;;;;;;;
Bora Bora from the air;;;;;;;;;
An Air Tahiti Pass is the Way to Go;;;;;;;;;
Because everything is so spread out, ferries only run between a couple of the islands and they’re usually infrequent and hard to find any information for. To get anywhere in French Polynesia, then, your only real option is to fly.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

I picked up an island hopping pass from Air Tahiti, which gave me close to a 50% discount on what I would have paid if I’d booked all of my flights individually. In total, I ended up paying just over $400 for seven flights. There are several options for island hopping passes, ranging from around $280 for three stops in the Society Islands to a whopping $750 to visit several islands in the Marquesas.;;;;;;;;;

And the Best Way to Get Around is by Bicycle;;;;;;;;;
I haven’t had the best of luck with bicycles when I travel, so it was a surprise that I grew to embrace them in French Polynesia. Like the island time I mentioned above, cycling slows you down, chills you out and ensures you don’t miss anything. I was always moving slow enough that the locals could call out to me as I passed, I was able to stop every few metres to snap a photo of a colourful flower or deserted beach, and the roads were well-paved, so it wasn’t painful to ride.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
If you travel around in a car or on a scooter, you miss a lot of that. You don’t see as much, smell as much, experience as much.;;;;;;;;;
There are, of course, exceptions, like Raiatea. The main road on the island runs for 92 miles around the coastline and the attractions are spread out, so exploring on foot or by bike was difficult.;;;;;;;;;

It’s Cheaper Than People Think;;;;;;;;;
When I announced that I was going to be visiting Bora Bora on a budget, people seemed skeptical. Big travel bloggers told me it wouldn’t be possible, because it was the most expensive place on the planet. After having been there, that statement simply isn’t true. Sure, it’s not Southeast Asia cheap, but I found prices to be in line with those in the Maldives or the Cook Islands, and less on some of the lesser-visited islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bora Bora is home to a dozen decent guesthouses with nightly rates that start from $50 (I’ll post my budget guide with all of the details within the next couple of weeks!) so if you’re travelling as part of a couple, that’s pretty cheap for somewhere that’s one of the prettiest places I’ve ever been.;;;;;;;;;
And yeah, I’ll be honest, there are some pain-in-the-ass-rip-off expenses that I totally expected for a place that attracts so much luxury tourism (see: the ridiculous costs at the luxury resort I stayed at in the Maldives). My guesthouse in Bora Bora, for example, emailed before I arrived to ask if I wanted to order a daily breakfast for $13 a day, stating that if I didn’t order it in advance, they’d increase the price to $19 a day after I arrived. Assuming they do that because there were no other food options nearby, I agreed. Bleh. There were plenty of places I could have eaten at, which would have been cheaper and tastier.;;;;;;;;;
Having said that, some things were cheaper than I expected: Air Tahiti offers a free ferry shuttle from the airport to the mainland for anyone who isn’t staying at a fancy resort. Most guesthouses offer free transfers from where the shuttle drops you off. Food wasn’t crazy-expensive and I usually ate for $10-15 a day. You can rent a bicycle for $10 a day to explore the island.;;;;;;;;;
When it came to the other islands, things got even more affordable. My guesthouse in Maupiti was $70 a night, but that included all of my meals, an airport transfer, and a free snorkelling trip to swim with manta rays, so I didn’t have to pay for anything else while I was there. In Huahine and Raiatea, I averaged $50 a day in total, and that’s as a solo traveller.;;;;;;;;;

The Best Parts of French Polynesia are Outside of Tahiti;;;;;;;;;
I was so freaking excited to get to Tahiti, because even just the name made it sound like this mystical, magical, tropical island paradise.;;;;;;;;;
Compared to the other islands I visited, it wasn’t. It’s built up, it’s developed, there’s traffic and trucks and it’s busy and there are enormous shopping malls and supermarkets. And a Mcdonald’s. When you compare that to a place like Maupiti, which has no ATMs, where everyone rides bicycles, where there’s a population of 1000, and where there’s not a single resort, there’s no competition. I much preferred the laid-back, go-slow, way of life outside of Tahiti.;;;;;;;;;
Tahiti felt a bit like being in the U.S. but with everyone speaking French.;;;;;;;;;

The Language Barrier was One of the Highest I’ve Ever Come Across;;;;;;;;;
Speaking of French, if you can’t speak more than a few words of it (like me), you’re going to struggle here. I’ve rarely come up against such a high language barrier in a place so set up for tourism, so this was a real surprise.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
I can count the number of locals I had a conversation with on two hands. Most of the guesthouses owners only spoke French, airport officials couldn’t understand my questions, and the cabin crew on Air Tahiti rarely used English. Even on Bora Bora, it was rare to find a local who spoke more than a few words of English. On Maupiti, my guesthouse owner spoke so little English that whenever she wanted to ask me a question or talk to me, she’d have to drag an English-speaking guest to my door to translate for her!;;;;;;;;;
I don’t really mind language barriers, and I definitely can’t complain about them, but it was isolating as a solo-traveller-who-couldn’t-find-any-other-solo-travellers and I did feel lonely at times. It also made it harder to get things done. When a guesthouse owner forgot to pick me up from a ferry terminal, for example, on an island with no taxis and where nobody seemed to speak English, I struggled to get out of the situation.;;;;;;;;;

But the Locals are Lovely;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to a place where literally every single local you pass calls out hello to you. That was French Polynesia for me. Everywhere I went, I was greeted with, “bonjour!” “bonjour!” “bonjour!” I felt so welcomed and safe, even with the big language barrier that meant we couldn’t exchange much else.;;;;;;;;;

On Maupiti, one of the guesthouse owners motioned for me to follow him after breakfast and proceeded to teach me how to crack open a coconut to wash down my meal with. He didn’t speak a word of English, but still took half an hour out of his day to teach me a new skill.;;;;;;;;;
On Raiatea, my apartment owner offered to take me dancing in the main town with her friends one night.;;;;;;;;;
On Huahine, a local I cycled past told me about a hike that isn’t well publicised, and insisted that he show me where the island’s sacred eels were, so that he could help me feed them.;;;;;;;;;

On Bora Bora, a group of local paddle boarders took me under their wings, plied me with a lime-coconut liquor, and told me everything I could possibly want to know about what it’s like to grow up in somewhere so isolated from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;
Flying in French Polynesia is always spectacular!;;;;;;;;;
Hostels are Rare;;;;;;;;;
I stayed in a dorm room in Tahiti, but didn’t find any hostels on any of the other islands I visited. And to be honest, at $25 a night for a crappy dorm that was full of mosquitoes, it offered far worse value than the $40-70 a night guesthouses I stayed in elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;
Outside of Tahiti, if you’re visiting on a budget, you’ll be staying in fares, small guesthouses with a single-digit number of rooms. They’re actually really lovely places and I felt like they offered great value for money. They’re also kind of like resorts for budget travellers: you’ll often eat your meals there, take a tour with the owners, and borrow their bicycles or car. It made everything really easy.;;;;;;;;;
Palm trees, flowers, jungle, and a volcano: Maupiti had it all!;;;;;;;;;
Solo Travelers Are Also Rare;;;;;;;;;
I met a handful of solo travelers in my hostel in Tahiti — staying in a dorm room no doubt helped — but as soon as I left, I didn’t meet any others. Just like I experienced in the Cook Islands, this felt very much like a destination for couples (especially honeymooners!) and families.;;;;;;;;;

Unlike in the Cook Islands, this wasn’t as much of an issue in French Polynesia. Because the fares are set up to be far more communal, I wasn’t eating alone every night and having nobody to chat to. Dinners were often included in the price of the guesthouse and were at a set time, so I got to hang out with other travellers and chat, which I loved.;;;;;;;;;
Views of Bora Bora as we came in to land;;;;;;;;;
Bora Bora Was Just as Spectacular as I’d Hoped;;;;;;;;;
It’s funny: I was so unenthusiastic about going to Bora Bora. It was my final stop on my trip and I’d already fallen in love with so many wonderful islands. I fully expected Bora Bora to look exactly the same as them, but to be full of fanny pack-brandishing tourists and overpriced everything.;;;;;;;;;

But Bora Bora is special and you should totally go there.;;;;;;;;;
Was it my favourite island? No. It was a little too hard to travel on a budget, had me feeling a little too much like I was being ripped off, the food wasn’t as good, and the beaches actually weren’t as nice as the ones I’d spent time on on other islands. But it was 100% the prettiest island overall. Being in Bora Bora is like being in a dream. ;;;;;;;;;

So, Which Island Was My Favourite?;;;;;;;;;
It’s tough to choose between Maupiti and Huahine, but I think the latter wins it for me. Huahine was gorgeous. It had the best beach I found in French Polynesia, it had tons to do, from exploring old abandoned hotels to feeding blue-eyed eels to hiking up a volcano. The locals were welcoming, the lagoon was beautiful, and the seafood was delicious. My favourite guesthouse was also in Huahine.;;;;;;;;;

Back when I was planning out my South Pacific jaunt, I believed that spending two weeks in French Polynesia would be enough for me. I thought that all of the islands would be similar, so if I could see a few, I’d be set for life.;;;;;;;;;
Every other year, I spend Christmases down in Oceania, which gives me the perfect opportunity to add on some South Pacific exploration either on the way there or afterwards. I thought that my next trip would be all about visiting Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, but now I’m not so sure.;;;;;;;;;

Now, I’m fairly certain I’m going to return to French Polynesia for at least a month. I miss it already.;;;;;;;;;

I mean, it’s really not my thing.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t get it. I don’t understand how people can run for more than a mile without stopping.;;;;;;;;;
Don’t their lungs feel like they’re about to explode? Don’t they get stitches within the first few minutes? Don’t they get stabbing pains in their lungs for the 72 hours following a half-mile run?;;;;;;;;;
If I try to run for more than a few minutes, I end up sat by the side of the road with my head between my knees, wondering whether I’m about to throw up or have a heart attack.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve tried and failed to take up running more times than I can count: I want to be a runner! I’m envious of runners.;;;;;;;;;
So, I start running, and I’m dedicated to my new challenge.;;;;;;;;;
At first, I can run around the block without stopping.;;;;;;;;;
Then, I start running five days a week to increase my distance, but mostly fail. There’s a voice in my head that starts ordering me to stop as soon as I start.;;;;;;;;;
I once ran regularly for a month straight and then finally, I could manage to run around the block plus an extra ten metres. It was progress; I soldiered on.;;;;;;;;
Three months later, I could run one whole mile without stopping. Six months later, I could run two miles. Um, people train for marathons in six months! I ran five days a week for six months straight and could only manage two miles in *cough* forty minutes.;;;;;;;;;
Surely it’s not meant to be this hard?;;;;;;;;;
When I announced at the start of this year that I wanted to be able to run ten kilometres without stopping by the end of it, a reader messaged me to say that anyone who can run a few kilometres can run ten of them!;;;;;;;;;
Not me.;;;;;;;;;
A few months ago, I managed to hit five kilometres on the treadmill without stopping. In forty-five minutes. And I ended up being so close to passing out that I lost my vision when I stopped. I then had chest pains for the next few days and lost all sensation in my feet for several hours.;;;;;;;;;
While I’m not inclined to believe people who say, “I’m just not a runner!” because I’ve read so many articles by people who once felt that way and are now ultra-marathoners, I really can’t see how I could ever be a runner.;;;;;;;;;
No matter how hard I try and how much effort I put into it, I always do terribly.;;;;;;;;;
In which I attempt to run in the Sahara Desert;;;;;;;;;
Back in 2015 — yes, this is a flashback post — I committed to trying as many new things as possible. Sure, travel has blessed me with a whole host of new experiences, but they were generally activities that occurred accidentally. I hadn’t been seeking them out, because I was terrified of them, but they still seemed to happen to me.;;;;;;;;;

2015 was the year I said no more! to being afraid of normal things. I was going to try everything that intimidated me, I was going to get even further outside of my comfort zone, and I was going to see how it affected my life.;;;;;;;;;
So I headed to the Netherlands in search of something new to try.;;;;;;;;;
Something like… a running tour.;;;;;;;;;

I spent the next few days worrying about how I was going to handle a running tour when I’d spent the past three months straight locked up in an apartment in Granada working, managing 30 steps a day if I was lucky. I was worried about ending up in a group full of excellent runners and holding everyone back. I was worried about having a heart attack part-way through the tour, because I’d been too embarrassed to stop when I needed to.;;;;;;;;;
I pretended to be sick on the morning of the tour, because that’s the only way I know how to get out of things I don’t want to do, even though I’ve done that roughly 173 times with Dave and he no longer believes a word of it.;;;;;;;;;
But it was still worth a try.;;;;;;;;;
By the time our tour guide knocked on our door, I had accepted my fate. I stepped outside with the grim knowledge that within mere minutes I would most likely be bleeding out into Maastricht’s river.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My eyes met Raoul’s and I forced a smile.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Hi, Lauren and Dave!” he beamed. “You’re in luck — it’s just us on the tour today!”;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t have been more relieved.;;;;;;;;;
“So, you love to run?” he asked, expecting enthusiastic whoops from Dave and I.;;;;;;;;;
Dave told him he did, while I grimaced and half-nodded my head.;;;;;;;;;
“I don’t have much running experience,” I said.;;;;;;;;;
“That’s fine,” he reassured me. “How often do you run?”;;;;;;;;;
Dave laughed. “She hasn’t even left the house in three months!”;;;;;;;;;
Raoul frowned.;;;;;;;;;
“I don’t run often,” I confessed. “And I’ve been writing a book this year, so I haven’t run at all so far.”;;;;;;;;;
If he was perplexed as to why I had signed up for a running tour, he didn’t let it show.;;;;;;;;;
“Well, just let me know if you need to stop at any point. We’ll take it slow.”;;;;;;;;;
I nodded, despite knowing my Britishness would never allow me to stop the tour.;;;;;;;;;
I wouldn’t want to put anyone else out.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And we were off!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I took a deep breath and broke into a light jog as we made our way from our apartment into the centre of Maastricht. As Dave and Raoul expertly weaved around pedestrians and dogs, I staggered along behind them like a drunk giraffe with a broken neck.;;;;;;;;;
We made it two hundred metres and stopped, thank god. I already had a stitch burning in my side.;;;;;;;;;
Our first port of call was the Derlon Hotel, which from the outside, looked like any other standard four-star hotel. Raoul led the way inside and took us down into the cellar, where we came face-to-face with some Roman ruins! Maastricht used to be a Roman military camp, and beneath the hotel, you can see the remains of several buildings, a road, and a temple — all from around 260 A.D.;;;;;;;;;
And that was the beauty of taking a tour like this, because I would have had no idea they were there otherwise.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We were off again! This time I lurched behind like an overexcited blind puppy, panting loudly, tongue hanging out, limbs swinging out at sharp angles, nudging into Dave every few seconds. I could already feel my face starting to burn up.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This time, we jogged roughly four hundred metres before we came to a halt. We were at an old water wheel. The oldest working water wheel in the Netherlands, in fact, which was originally built in the 7th Century. These days, it powers a vintage flour mill for a small bakery in town.;;;;;;;;;
My favourite stop, however, was the Bookstore Dominicanen, a 13th century Dominican church that has been renovated into a bookstore. It’s regularly voted the most beautiful in the world, and I can’t argue with that. It was gorgeous!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The rest of the tour continued in a similar vein as before. We would run for a few hundred metres, I would feel like I was going to die, and we’d pause just as I was about to swallow my pride and ask for a break. Our rests would last a couple of minutes while Raoul told us a cool fact about something we would have ordinarily walked past without noticing. Once we’d learned the history behind the spot, we’d resume our run once more.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I appreciated the much slower speeds on this tour, and especially appreciated that there were stops every few minutes.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t quite get to bleed out on that day.;;;;;;;;;
Given that I’m basically the worst runner to have ever existed, I’m convinced that most people could take this running tour in Maastricht and survive. I could tell that it was really easy going — we ran 5 kilometres in 90 minutes — even if it did feel like sprinting a marathon to me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As the tour drew to a close, Raoul led us straight to a cosy bar full of locals in town and bought us both a beer to celebrate our accomplishments.;;;;;;;;;
And it felt like a huge accomplishment for me.;;;;;;;;;
I’m not going to lie: the tour was a struggle, and there were times I was convinced I was going to throw up if I had to run for much longer, but with endorphins flooding my system afterwards, I was already making plans for taking running tours in every city I visit in the future.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And as for Dave? Well, as a lover of all things running, he was thrilled to run his way around the city and even joined Raoul for a 10 kilometre run into Belgium and back the very next day.;;;;;;;;;
I sat that one out.;;;;;;;;;
"Does taking a running tour of a city sound like your idea of heaven or hell?""";;;;;;;;;

2015 had been a blend of amazing and terrible, and I was determined to put all the bad stuff behind me and make some positive changes in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;
I predicted back then that the theme of my 2016 was going to be change, but it turned out instead to be incrementalism. I’ll expand on this when I publish the results of my 2016 goals next week, but in short: I learned that just because January had rolled around, my struggles weren’t going to magically disappear.;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t going to stop having panic attacks just because it was a new year.;;;;;;;;;
My immune system wasn’t going to heal itself just because I thought it really should have by now.;;;;;;;;;
Baby steps are everything.;;;;;;;;;
For a long time I fought as hard as I could against admitting I was struggling. I started the year unwell, stressed, anxious, and in desperate need of a break to work on my health. I was too embarrassed to admit to anyone that I was still being slammed by panic attacks, so I shamed, shamed, shamed myself instead and pretended my life was wonderful. Rather than getting the help I needed, I pushed myself to continue exploring the world and told myself that it would cure my anxiety — after all, that’s exactly what it did five years ago. By ignoring every warning sign, I contracted half a dozen infections, had to take a horrifying number of antibiotics, and learned that my high levels of stress over the past couple of years have most likely resulted in an autoimmune disease and chronic pain.;;;;;;;;;
On my Facebook page a few days ago, I summarised this year and said that the first six months were easily some of the worst of my life, and this gives you a small insight into why.;;;;;;;;;
But the second six months were some of the absolute best of my life. I’m ending the year on a high and feel stronger and happier than ever.;;;;;;;;;
I visited sixteen countries in 2016, seven of them new. I hiked in New Zealand, swam in lagoons in the Cook Islands, sunbathed on one of the best beaches in the world in Bora Bora, ate my way around Mexico and the U.S., fell instantly in love with Lisbon, chartered a yacht in Greece, cruised the canals in Venice, celebrated five years with the most caring boyfriend in the world, made my health my priority, learned to meditate, taught myself to cook, made dozens of friends, and so much more.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
So as the clock struck twelve yesterday? I turned to Dave and announced that this is going to be my year.;;;;;;;;;
I’m entering 2017 filled with optimism, determination, and wanderlust, and can’t wait to see where this year takes me.;;;;;;;;;
But enough waffling. Here’s what I got up to in 2016!;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top-left: Flying over New Zealand; lagoon cruising in Aitutaki; the amazing colour of the water in Bora Bora, and Huahine: my favourite place in the South Pacific!;;;;;;;
January;;;;;;;;;
January was all about island hopping my way around the South Pacific! And damn, I’m not sure I’ll ever have a month filled with so many paradisiacal destinations again.;;;;;;;;;
I spent my previous New Year in London, so I kickstarted 2016 in New Zealand with a chilled week with Dave’s family. We were based in Hanmer Springs, where his parents have a holiday home, and spent our time enjoying the warm weather, hanging out in the local hot springs, and hiking part of the St James Walkway. I used hiking boots that were too small for me and one of my toenails turned black.;;;;;;;;;
Next up was the Cook Islands, a destination I’ve been dreaming of visiting for years. Despite experiencing more than my fair share of bad luck while I was in the country, getting to take a lagoon cruise in Aitutaki more than made up for it. The Cook Islands were magical and easily one of my new favourite countries.;;;;;;;;;
From the Cook Islands, I bounced over to French Polynesia and fell in love with this gorgeous island nation. I spent my time exploring the Society Islands of Maupiti, Raiatea, Huahine, and Bora Bora, then realised I had only scratched the surface of what this destination can offer. I’m already making plans to return at the end of this year.;;;;;;;;;
From Bora Bora, I moved on to Fiji, where I’d planned on spending three weeks island hopping across the Yasawa Islands. By the time I landed in Nadi, though, I realised I needed a break from travel. I’d been moving far too fast in the South Pacific and it was starting to show — I was exhausted and fighting off cold after cold after cold.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I changed my flights and flew to Mexico early to reunite with Dave and hang out with the dozen or so travel bloggers who were in town. While I’m sad I didn’t get a chance to see more of Fiji on this trip, I know that skipping it in favour of some rest was the right decision.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: A typical street in Oaxaca; celebrating Pancake Day with Dave for the first time; 90% of what I did in Oaxaca was eat tacos; sunset over Oaxaca’s cathedral on one of our final nights in the city.;;;;;;
February;;;;;;;;;
I landed in Oaxaca via the worst travel day ever, then immediately set about filling my stomach with tacos.;;;;;;;;;
Just kidding. I actually went straight to the doctor, because I’d managed to contract three separate infections at once. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of the slow deterioration of my immune system.;;;;;;;;;
I’d had great plans for my time in Oaxaca, but achieved very few of them, and I’m okay with that. When you travel full-time, getting to spend multiple days in a row with good friends is rare, so being in the same city as a dozen of mine for an entire month was like Christmas. I let travel take a backseat in Oaxaca and instead checked out some of the best restaurants and taco stands in town, developed an obsession with mezcal margaritas, and marvelled at how inexpensive it was to live there. We paid just $250 for a month in our apartment!;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: Getting to dogsit for Leo, the best dog in the world; a cocktail tour of New Orleans’ best bars; touring the Louisiana swamps by boat; the gorgeous New Orleans architecture.;;;;;;
March;;;;;;;;;
I try to visit the United States at least once a year, and always try to squeeze in a jaunt to my beloved Pacific Northwest while I’m there. This trip was no different.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This time around, Dave and I were dogsitting for some friends in Seattle and gleefully took over their lives for four weeks of domesticity. I’ve always thought that if I could live anywhere in the U.S., I’d choose Portland, but my month in Seattle has me rethinking that plan. I loved it there! The food scene was amazing, the people were lovely, we have a ton of friends to hang out with, and looking after Leo was basically the best thing I’ve ever done. When I was struck down by two further infections this month, having him come to comfort me whenever I cried has me convinced that dogs are everything.;;;;;;;;;
From a rainy Seattle, I flew to a humid New Orleans to meet up with my family and undertake a music-themed road trip through the American South, which was a brand new region for me.;;;;;;;;;
I arrived in New Orleans expecting to hate it, but it’s now one of my favourite cities in the world! And travelling as tourists rather than travel bloggers meant that we were cramming in a whole bundle of activities into our few days in the Big Easy. We learned about the city’s history through it’s best bars and cocktails on a kickass cocktail-themed walking tour; journeyed into the Louisiana swamps for an afternoon of alligator-spotting; wandered around the historic homes and enormous mansions in the Garden district; and discovered some of the best live music in the city in the bars on Frenchmen Street.;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Despite such an action-packed itinerary, I feel like I only managed to scratch the surface of what New Orleans has to offer and can’t wait to return in the future for more bar-hopping and beignets.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: having fun on Beale Street in Memphis; jumping for joy outside Graceland; celebrating being in Nashville with a beer in a cowboy boot-shaped glass; Downtown Nashville on a gloriously sunny day.;;;;;;
April;;;;;;;;;
The road trip continues! Next up was a few days in Memphis, which again, I loved so much more than I was expecting to. I mean, I seriously loved Memphis. Beale Street was lively, vibrant, colourful, and full of ribs and live music. I realised I could never eat ribs again after devouring the best of my life while I was in the city. I took a really cheesy trip out to Graceland that ended up being so much better than expected, and visited some fantastic and eye-opening museums.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next up, Nashville, which was, again, another destination I fell in love with! I’m not much of a country music fan, so a visit to the Country Music Hall of Fame was, um, really boring. But everything else was perfection: the Johnny Cash museum was one of the best I’ve been to, the food scene in East Nashville was a hipster dream, and I still regret not buying a pair of cowboy boots while I was there. I was really into Nashville and left claiming that I could see myself happily living there one day.;;;;;;;;;
We rounded off our U.S. travels with a special trip to Miami. This was hopefully going to be our very last destination of our full-time travels, so we booked a fancy apartment on South Beach, and I treated Dave to Pearl Jam tickets while we were there. And guys? I loved Miami so much more than I was expecting to! The art deco architecture had me wanting to buy an apartment in South Beach, the crab eggs benedicts had me wanting to eat breakfast in Miami every day, and the beach was just as beautiful as I’d been hoping.;;;;;;;;;
It was the perfect way to round off five years of full-time travel.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: hunting down the best viewpoints in Lisbon; exploring Girona with friends; checking out Nazare, home to the biggest wave ever surfed; the beautiful cathedral in Alcobaca.;;;;;;
May;;;;;;;;;
In May, I arrived in Lisbon and instantly fell in love. Travel had been making me feel unwell, so it was time to pause for a while and put down some roots in Portugal. I always thought it would feel like an enormous and terrifying step to make such a huge commitment after so many years of freedom, but the decision felt nothing but perfect.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Instead of settling into Lisbon, though, we immediately jumped on a plane to Spain because that’s what we do. We flew out to Girona for the first time to see some travel blogging friends who were living there, and then I promptly got what I think was salmonella. I’ve never had food poisoning like it! So, Girona? I liked the small part I got to see of it.;;;;;;;;;
When I wasn’t in Spain, I was back in Portugal and road tripping around with a local friend I met through this site! We drove out to see UNESCO World Heritage site Monastery of Santa Maria d’Alcobaça in, um, Alcobaca, almost got blown away by the strong winds in Nazare, home to the largest wave ever surfed, and drank cherry liqueur from a chocolate cup in Obidos.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: my favourite local beach in Lisbon; … the same beach from another angle; working in the sunshine on my apartment terrace; views of Lisbon from the castle.;;;;;;
June;;;;;;;;;
June was all about staying put in Lisbon in order to get to know the city a little better. My parents paid me a visit for a weekend this month, too, which gave me the perfect excuse to check out what brings the tourists to Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I regularly took trains and trams and buses out to the best beaches in the city, I set myself a challenge of finding the best pasteis de nata in the city, clambered up to the castle and marvelled at the views, wandered around the narrow alleyways of Alfama, and even celebrated my birthday in the best possible way (beaches, cupcakes, and heated slippers.);;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: a typical meal on the Whole30: grilled salmon in a lime sauce with garlic, tomatoes, and zucchini; Evora from above; the main square in Evora; the yellow and white buildings of Evora.;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I set myself a challenge of doing the Whole30 at the start of the year and in order to do it successfully, I needed to take travel off the cards for an entire month and focus on my health.;;;;;;;;;
And I’ve already said a bajillion times that it was the best thing I’ve ever done for myself.;;;;;;;;;
The Whole30 was all about me finally finding the baby step I’d needed to take in order to get myself on the road to recovery. As I write this post, almost six months later, I’m excited to tell you that prior to jumping on the Whole30, I was experiencing panic attacks multiple times a day and barely leaving the house. And now? I haven’t had a single panic attack since finishing the Whole30, and my anxiety has never risen above a 2 or 3 out of 10 since.;;;;;;;;;
I celebrated finishing the Whole30 with a trip out to Evora, which is said to be the Tuscany of Portugal. It’s known for its fantastic wine and food scene, and I spent a few days eating and drinking as much as possible. I genuinely had some of the best meals of my life there! Dave and I were staying in an old converted monastery while we were there, which was as amazing as it sounds (very), and spent our time wandering around the beautiful white and yellow buildings, checking out the amazing Roman temple that was steps away from our hotel, and battling stomach cramps, because eating dairy and gluten after a month of elimination can be excruciating.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: the Roman ruins in Evora; getting back to my pre-travel weight after the Whole30!; catching a movie in a London park at sunset.;;;;;;;

As August rolled around, I took advantage of my European base and flew to London to visit my family for a few weeks.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
First up was a week in London, where we made the decision to head east rather than back to Brixton. It was the right decision as we immediately fell for hipster Hackney and its bustling Broadway Market. As always in London, we filled our days with snacking at street food markets, catching up with friends, and realising that we really should have planned for more time in the city.;;;;;;;;;
When our time in London drew to a close, Dave and I journeyed north for my first visit to Oxford. Dave’s brother is studying at Oxford Univeristy, so we hopped up to see him for a few days and spent our time snooping around the college grounds.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: sailing the Ionian; visiting the Bridge of Sighs with twenty thousand other tourists in Venice; hitting up the biggest tourist attractions in Berlin; and street art touring in Berlin.;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I began my travels in Greece: first, with a week on Corfu, and second, with a life-changing ten days on the ocean. I loved chartering a yacht in the Ionian, and my newfound confidence about all things sailing showed me that I was back on track to being the anxiety-free person I used to be. Plus, my new dairy-free diet meant that I stopped getting seasickness, which made the whole experience so much more enjoyable. I can’t wait to get back on the water again!;;;;;;;;;
From Greece, I said goodbye to Dave and flew to Venice for a few short hours spent making the most of a layover. I bused my way into the city, cruised along the canals, grabbed a strawberry cheesecake gelato, and thought about how Venice would be my favourite city in Europe if it wasn’t for the thousands of tourists.;;;;;;;;;
Next on my list was Berlin, and now that I was in a better place mentally, I was able to get back to pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I stayed at a 5-star hotel and spent way too much money on pretending I was a luxury traveller. I treated myself to my first massage since Bangkok at one of the best spas in Europe. I ate alone at a two Michelin Star restaurant. I worked out in the fancy gym everyday. And when I wasn’t pretending to have more money than I actually do, I spent my time hopping around the tourist sites, meeting up with friends, and taking a tour of an underground bunker, where I put on a fake New Zealand accent.;;;;;;;;;
Onwards! Next on my list was Paris, which was probably my biggest European oversight of all. I based myself in the Marais neighbourhood, which was amazing, and visited the Eiffel Tower, checked out the Louvre, wandered around Père Lachaise Cemetery, and failed at trying to stick to a paleo diet. I also almost got scammed and thought I’d seen the Arc de Triomphe when I had, in fact, seen a tiny arch that looked nothing like it.;;;;;;;;;

October;;;;;;;;;
The travels continue! Next up on my agenda was Luxembourg, which I now firmly believe is the most underrated country in Western Europe. It was so wonderful! I spent most of my time in Luxembourg City, but managed to squeeze in a day trip to the fairytale village of Vianden while I was there, too.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next up was a week in Nice, which, um, was a bit of a disaster. I’d planned to road trip my way across the French Riviera but when I arrived and found police cars on every street, policemen with massive guns on every block, and a nervous, jumpy population of locals, I’m embarrassed to say I let fear win. Rather than beach hopping along the coast, I spent most of my time inside and feeling fearful whenever I made it down to the streets below. I’m annoyed I didn’t get to take advantage of my time in such a beautiful part of the world, especially as I visited to prove you can’t let the terrorists win.;;;;;;;;;
One thing I did manage to do while I was in Nice was check out a new country. I spent a day in Monaco and honestly, it was  boring. The mountain scenery was impressive, and it was cool to see all the fancy yachts, but there wasn’t really that much to do that. I’m glad I got to see it, but I can’t see myself returning anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;
To celebrate breaking up with my panic attacks, I decided to change up my appearance and go blonde!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From the age of 16 up until the day I left to travel, I’d always had my hair coloured various shades of the rainbow, but I’d never been brave enough to try blonde. I stopped colouring my hair when I started travelling because, well, I’m lazy and it sounded too hard to maintain. Now that I’ll be in one place for six months of the year, I wanted to do something drastic to celebrate my clean bill of mental health. I researched the best salon in Barcelona, let them dump a bucket of bleach on my head, and ended up thrilled with the result, thank god!;;;;;;;;;
The final part of my Europe trip was an incredible tour from Barcelona. The trip takes you to three countries in one day and I loved that it allowed me to see so much of Andorra. We stopped at a medieval village called Braga, in Spain; Ax Les Thermes, a village full of thermal hot springs in France; and then spent our afternoon driving around multiple towns and villages in Andorra. Most people who head to Andorra only visit the capital city, so this was a great way to see more of what it has to offer. I’d definitely return in the future — the small parts I saw were gorgeous.;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: two terrible phone photos of the delicious meal we had for our anniversary; the Camino map I had commissioned for Dave for Christmas; a view of Lisbon because I definitely don’t have any photos to share for this month.;;;;;;;
November;;;;;;;;;
November was a laid back month spent hanging out with friends old and new. And I always know I’ve had a good month when I look back and realise I was having too much fun to take any photos!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This month, I celebrated Thanksgiving with a huge get-together at a friend’s place, where I discovered cornbread and honey butter and devoured it until I felt sick. I also found some amazing bars and tasty restaurants I can’t wait to write about, and even got to have friends stay over, which feels so good after having spent five years abusing others’ hospitality and sofas as we’ve travelled around the world!;;;;;;;;;
I celebrated my five year anniversary with Dave this month, too! After developing a taste for fancy, expensive food in Berlin, we opted for a meal at a Michelin Star restaurant in Lisbon to celebrate the occasion. It was totally worth it, although definitely a once-a-year occasion from now on!;;;;;;;;;
November was also about improving my health. I spent a lot of money getting extensive bloodwork done this month in order to learn more about my body, how my organs are functioning, and what I need to do to improve my immune system, recover from the many antibiotics I’d taken, and keep my anxiety at bay. I learned a ton and have already taken steps to help me live happier and healthier. Unsurprisingly, my results showed me that my gut flora was all over the place, that I have some deficiencies that are linked with anxiety, and that my white blood cell counts and liver function were a little all over the place. Yay for antibiotics!;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: discovering a magical wonderland full of sardines in Lisbon; heading home for Christmas with my love; happy to be home, but also cold; going to a rugby match in Twickenham over Christmas.;;;;;;
December;;;;;;;;;
Just when I thought things were getting back on track, 2016 couldn’t resist giving me one final slap in the face. It was in December that I found myself battling yet another infection, on yet another course of antibiotics, and making the discovery that I most likely have an auto immune disease that could have me in pain for the rest of my life. If there’s one thing I’ve learned this year, it’s that stress is not something to be taken lightly or ignored. It can seriously mess with your health.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
But let’s end on a happy note! I finished up my year with a trip home to London, where I’ve had one of the best Christmases of my life. Meals at my favourite restaurants, films at my favourite cinema, catching up with friends and having a big family reunion, going to a rugby match, heading to an amazing cinema that’s made to look like you’re sitting in someone’s back garden, attempting to find the cosiest pub in London, and going for walks beside the river.;;;;;;;;;
I ended this year on a high and I can’t wait to see where 2017 will lead me!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back in 2011, I stepped on a plane with the dream of traveling the world for a year. I thought I’d follow the gap year rite of passage for 12 months, have the time of my life, then head home to rejoin the real world. Unexpectedly, several months into this adventure, I turned this little travel blog into a business, began to make money from it, and realised that I didn’t have to ever go home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So that’s exactly what I did. I travelled and I travelled and I saw some incredible sights and I met some incredible people.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Then, it was time to stop. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Continuous travel, it turned out, was not sustainable for me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wanted a home. Somewhere familiar to return to to decompress after trips. I wanted to enrich my life with more than all travel all the time, like having a constant set of friends I didn’t have to say goodbye to. I wanted a kitchen and a gym membership, so I could work on improving my health. I wanted to focus on this site, so that I could post regularly for you guys rather than squeezing out one article a month because travel is vacuuming my time and energy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The only question I had to ask myself was: where?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d travelled for so long and fallen in love with so many places, that I simply couldn’t choose just one. There were too many wonderful cities scattered all over the globe, and FOMO had me wanting to try them all on for size.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was time to start narrowing my options down.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Coming up With Our Criteria for a Base;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
With so many countries for my boyfriend, Dave, and I to choose from, we were fortunate to be able to be picky — we could choose anywhere in the world to live!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, this wealth of choice left us paralysed and we spent literal years debating where we should make our home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Eventually, we put together a detailed list of things we wanted and needed from a potential home. If you’re considering moving to Portugal, or somewhere new, I highly recommend doing the same.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d love to live in Taipei, but getting a work or residency visa would be challenging;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here are the factors that were most important for us:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Needed to Be Able to Legally Live and Work There;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I knew I wouldn’t be able to make a success of expat life unless I threw myself fully into living in a place. I’ve had plenty of three-month-long stays in cities around the world, but they’ve never felt like home because I always knew I’d be leaving soon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t want this to happen in the country I chose for my home, so our first rule was that both Dave and I would have to be able to legally live and work there. I love Bangkok and Saigon and Taipei, and many places in Mexico, for example, but if we moved there, we’d be living from tourist visa to tourist visa, never knowing if we’d be let back into the country when we left.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wanted to give this whole finding a base thing my best shot and buy furniture, make local friends, and build a community. I knew I’d only be able to do all of that good stuff if there wasn’t a risk of me being suddenly kicked out of the country.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This helped drastically lower the number of places for our potential base. I’m British and Dave’s from New Zealand, but he also has a British passport.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Thanks to our British passports, we can both legally work and live in any EU countries (we were making this decision before Brexit was even a word in our vocabulary), and I’d be able to get a partner visa for Australia or New Zealand fairly easily through Dave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From a work perspective, both Dave and I work online, so we wouldn’t need to worry about finding a job in whichever country we chose to settle in. As long as we could legally live and work there, we’d be fine.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Okay, so that narrowed our options down to around 30 countries. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wouldn’t be able to afford to eat many brunches like this if I chose to live in Australia!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Needed to Be Able to Comfortably Afford to Live in Our Chosen Country;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
While I was travelling full-time, I had a fantastic quality of life, which was something I didn’t want to give up after finding a base.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I still wanted to be able to afford to eat out at nice restaurants, I wanted to be able to see friends regularly, I wanted to be able to travel for three months of every year, and be able to afford that on top of our rent. Basically, I didn’t want to sacrifice the quality of life we had on the road through choosing to find a home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That helped eliminate quite a few destinations. I estimated that my monthly expenses (rent, bills, gym membership, food, etc) in my new home city would have to work out to be no more than $1,500 a month.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That knocked out the big cities in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. Pricey Scandinavian countries were off the cards, too, and so were more expensive countries in Western Europe, like Switzerland.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Wanted to Have Friends, and They’d Have to Be Planning to Stay in Our Chosen City Long-Term;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave is an extrovert who loses his mind if he doesn’t have friends to hang out with. We’ve tried living in places where we don’t know anybody else and after a few weeks, he becomes agitated, moody, and frustrated. He needs people to be happy. And as people who both work online and at home, it can be tough to get outside and make friends.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
An important criteria for us, then, was knowing lots of people in the city we chose, and hopefully they would be people who were settled and weren’t going to be leaving in a few months.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We’d already decided we wanted to live somewhere within the EU, so we started to make a list of places where we knew people, as well as some major digital nomad hubs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This helped us narrow it down to a few places: Lisbon; Granada, Barcelona, or Madrid; Berlin; Vienna; Amsterdam; Budapest; Bucharest.;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Needed to Live Somewhere With a Busy International Airport;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Even with a base, travel is easily going to be one of my highest priorities — I’m a travel writer, after all. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Most of the places I mentioned above have easy access to an airport, aside from Granada, so that knocked it off our list. Having to (most likely) bus to Malaga, and then fly onwards to our destination was an annoying deal-breaker for us.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Wanted to Live Somewhere With Great Weather;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After five years spent following the sun around the world, I have little tolerance for cold weather. That, combined with poor blood circulation, makes low temperatures painful for my extremities, and leaves me spending most of my days beneath blankets. If I had the opportunity to choose where to live, I was going to prioritise somewhere warm.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Europe, however, is not the warmest of continents in winter, even in the south. But the southern temperatures were way more bearable than the north.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
By this point, we had noticed that both Spain and Portugal ticked all of our boxes.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was time to book a flight.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Decision to Move to Portugal;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Was a reasonably spontaneous one.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Two friends had recently moved there and couldn’t stop gushing about how it was the perfect city to live. We had a chat with them, decided it would be worth checking out, and booked a one-way ticket to Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Neither of us had even been to the city before.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We booked a month-long stay in an Airbnb apartment, then gave ourselves thirty days to look around, get a feel for the city, and see if it was a place we could see ourselves committing to.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It took exactly three days.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Three days after arriving, Lisbon felt perfect. It was beautiful and sunny and affordable and wonderful. Lisbon had everything I’d been looking for in a home, so we immediately began looking at apartments.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One month later, we hung up our backpacks, and started to make ourselves at home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon was now home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s why I love living in Portugal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We Have Friends Here;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When we moved to Lisbon, we knew just two people. Now, we’re closing in on 20. Just as our friends had convinced us to move here, they also managed to convince over a dozen more people to do exactly the same. One by one, kickass digital nomads have arrived in the city, fallen in love, and decided to sign leases within a few days of arriving.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Which is amazing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We’re now part of a vibrant community of entrepreneurs in the city and know enough people to have someone to hang out with every day of the month if we liked. Lisbon’s become a huge digital nomad and tech startup hub over the past couple of years, and I’m thrilled to be here to watch it develop.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s Affordable;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Portugal is one of the cheapest countries in Western Europe, but Lisbon has been growing in popularity over recent years and becoming more expensive. Accommodation, in particular, in Lisbon is pricey, but everything else is incredibly affordable.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At local cafes, you can grab a starter, main, glass of wine, and a coffee for under €5! I usually spend under €10 a meal at some of the best restaurants I’ve ever eaten at — when drinking water. Bottles of good wine from the supermarket are around €2. For unlimited rides on all forms of public transport, a monthly pass is €35. Fruit and vegetables are cheap (you can grab a kilogram of strawberries, for example, for just €3.) Museums are free to enter on the first Sunday of every month.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation, however, is getting expensive. You’re looking at around €1400 for a two-bedroom apartment in a reasonably central part of Lisbon, which is double what you’d have paid if you’d come here ten years ago.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon is So Walkable;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In the 18 months I’ve been living in Lisbon, I’ve used the metro exactly once and that was to get to the airport. I seriously have so little need to use public transport because Lisbon is such a compact city. And if I don’t feel like walking, taking an Uber the distance it would take me to walk 30 minutes is less than €5.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In this city, everywhere you could possibly need to get to is within a twenty minute walk, which makes seeing friends, sightseeing, and trying out new restaurants and bars super easy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Food Scene is Spectacular;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Some of the best restaurants I’ve ever eaten in are in Lisbon. That’s not an exaggeration either. Local Portuguese food is delicious, and there are amazing international restaurants here, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Within a five-minute walk of my apartment in Principe Real, I can find some of the best Italian, Austrian, Mexican, Peruvian, Japanese, Argentinian, and Nepalese food of my life. I can even get better tacos than I had in Mexico! And life-changing burgers! There are cute coffee shops to work from nearby, too, one of which has the best cupcakes ever, and another of which has Vegemite toast. There’s the cosiest speakeasy bar close by, and a tasty gin bar within walking distance. We even splashed out on a Michelin Star restaurant for our five-year anniversary last month.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon isn’t really known as a food destination, but practically everything I’ve eaten has been so. freaking. delicious. I’m almost on the verge of declaring it my favourite city to eat in.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The only downside? We can’t find a really good Vietnamese restaurant!;;;;;;;;;

The Weather in Lisbon is Perfect;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Today is the 12th December and as sit on my apartment’s terrace, I’m looking out at bright blue skies with not a single cloud to ruin them. It’s 16 degrees (61F) today. Last week, it got as high as 20. That’s the type of European winter I love.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was wondering whether planning to base myself in Europe would lead to me heading further afield over the winter months, but so far, I’m loving the mild weather. There’s something about having picnics and wine in my local park in late-October that never fails to have me appreciating my life in Portugal.;;;;;;;;;

Lisbon is a Great Base to Travel From;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon isn’t a major capital city in Europe, so I was nervous this would lead to expensive flights whenever I wanted to fly somewhere new. Fortunately, this hasn’t been the case at all!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon is perfectly situated to pick up bargain flights across Europe and Africa, both of which are going to be major travel focuses of mine over the next couple of years. Return flights to the U.S. can often be had for as little as $300, which makes popping over to see friends an easy trip to make. My return flights to South Africa for February were $250 return from Lisbon!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re considering moving to Lisbon and like to travel regularly, you’ll be seriously impressed with the cheap flights this city offers.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
English is Widely Spoken in Portugal;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I can’t believe how much English is spoken in Lisbon. It’s like being in the U.K., or at least the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s embarrassing to admit, but for my first six months in Lisbon, I knew three Portuguese words. Eeek. Don’t worry — I’m not planning on becoming one of those British expats, and I’m now taking daily Portuguese lessons.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But. The fact that I’ve been able to get by using English has made moving here so easy. Our estate agent spoke English, our landlord speaks English. Menus in restaurants are in English. All of the personal trainers at our gym speak English. If we stop anyone in the street or in stores, there’s a 90% chance they’ll speak English if they’re young. We found it easy to make friends with locals, too, and they appreciate the opportunity to practice their English while teaching us some Portuguese.;;;;;;;;;

I struggled a lot when basing myself in Granada and Madrid last year because the language barrier was so high (and I’ve studied Spanish for five years!). In Lisbon, I barely notice one. It’s definitely made making local friends far easier than it should have been.;;;;;;;;;

Are There Any Downsides?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Nowhere’s perfect and living in Lisbon does have some downsides. I’m all about sharing the reality of destinations, so let’s take a look at what sucks about living here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
First, Lisbon is one of the hilliest cities I’ve ever come across — it definitely earns its nickname of the San Francisco of Europe. Practically every single street is on a hill, aside from the one that runs alongside the river. It’s not the end of the world, and I’m mostly used to it now, but it does make running outside practically impossible. And it’s kind of annoying when every walk you take ends up being an enormous workout. Sometimes I just want to go and buy a loaf of bread and it not leave me exhausted and sweaty.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Second, ordering stuff online is a horrendous process.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For some reason, if you order anything from the U.S., it will be stopped by Portuguese customs and they’ll seriously investigate every single package. And that can take months. Dave ordered a backpack from the U.S. and argued with customs for two months because they didn’t believe the price he’d paid for it was correct — they actually sent the backpack back to the store! Friends have ordered supplements and had them kept at customs for four months. I ordered a gift for a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer and by the time I received it, six months later, she was in remission.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yes — you read that correctly. A small gift I bought from Etsy in the U.S. took six. whole. months. to pass through Portuguese customs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s a nightmare and super-frustrating, as Dave’s business relies on him receiving review samples from the U.S.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and the bureaucracy can be infuriating. Few people in the government can accurately explain how things work, and we’re regularly given different answers by different people. There’s close to no decent information about moving to Portugal online — half of what we read turned out to be false once we landed and met with a local lawyer and accountant. We haven’t been able to figure out how to get access to Portuguese healthcare after 18 months in the city, which makes dealing with medical issues an expensive nightmare. I suffer from an auto-immune disease that’s one of the most painful conditions on the planet, so the bills can quickly add up.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A lot of the time, we have no idea whether we’re doing things right or going to be caught out at some point.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Really, though, these are my only frustrations, and they’re minor in the grand scheme of things.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Do You Want to Move to Portugal?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve started receiving a ton of emails from people who have read this post and are convinced they want to move to Portugal, too. That’s great!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Your first step is to research whether you can legally move to Portugal if you’re not an EU citizen. An immigration lawyer will be able to help you navigate the world of Portuguese visas far better than I can, so that should be your first step if you’re serious about a life in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Based on conversations with friends who moved to Portugal, I believe there’s a visa available to people who work online and have enough money in their savings to prove they can support themselves for at least a year within the country. And there’s a retirement visa that’s easily accessible, too. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re younger, don’t work online, don’t have in-demand qualifications, and/or don’t have much in your savings, it’s likely not going to be possible for you to move to Portugal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
"But! I’m not an expert, as my British passport meant that I could live and work in Portugal without needing to apply for a visa.""";;;;;;;;;

I used to book my hostels by sorting them by the lowest price and picking the cheapest dorm, no matter how bad the reviews were. At the time, I was travelling off my savings and I reasoned that a bed was a bed — if I spent $5 a night instead of $10 for a month, I’d have an extra $300 by the end of it, which would then give me another full month of travelling and staying at $5 a night hostels.;;;;;;;;;
Unsurprisingly, that quickly grew old and I learned about the importance of value when you travel.;;;;;;;;;
Sure, I could save money and travel for longer by choosing the cheapest accommodation I could find, but if I wasn’t happy, was it really worth it?;;;;;;;;;
I quickly found this extreme form of budget travel wasn’t great for my health. Nights in crappy dorm rooms led to poor sleep, frequent illnesses, and increased stress levels, and I was nearly always staying on the outskirts of a city.;;;;;;;;;
All of that combined meant that although I was saving a ton of money, I wasn’t actually enjoying travel and I was seeing far less of the places I visited — I was always too tired or too sick or too far away to work up the motivation to explore.;;;;;;;;;
The type of bed I used to sleep in;;;;;;;;;
A few years ago, I swore off this way of travelling.;;;;;;;;;
And for the most part, I’ve stuck with it. I now spend months at a time in cities, choosing to stay in Airbnb apartments rather than cheap hostels, and when I do opt for a hostel, I choose the highest-rated one I can find. I will always pay more for a flight than I used to, justifying that leaving and arriving at a reasonable time and not having to deal with a series of long layovers are worth the extra couple of hundred dollars.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In the South Pacific, though? It wasn’t quite so easy.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll probably write a post about how to plan a trip to the South Pacific at some point, because it was so goddamn hard.;;;;;;;;;
Many of the countries are not super-popular tourist destinations, and because most people only visit one country per trip rather than many, getting around is a pain in the ass. Direct flights are near-impossible to find, so most of the flights I looked at included a layover in Australia or New Zealand, giving me a 24-hour travel day. If you find a direct flight, or an affordable flight, it can run as infrequently as once every other week. You get the idea — island hopping in this part of the world is tricky.;;;;;;;;;
So there I was in Bora Bora and I needed to get to Oaxaca, in Mexico.;;;;;;;;;
Oaxaca was waiting;;;;;;;;;
What followed was easily the worst travel day of my life.;;;;;;;;;
And I’m calling it a travel day, but it actually took five days for me to get to Mexico. My journey involved three nights sleeping on different airport floors, and I travelled by pickup truck, catamaran, many planes, taxis, and collectivos. Oh, and to top it off, I got two ear infections and a sinus infection mid-way through the journey.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how it went down.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Leg One: Bora Bora to Tahiti;;;;;;;;;
I started off slow and easy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A pickup truck took me from my guesthouse in Bora Bora to the main ferry terminal in Vaitape, where I boarded the Air Tahiti catamaran shuttle to the airport island. From there, I jumped on a tiny plane and made my way back to Tahiti.;;;;;;;;;
Stopover One: Six hours in Papeete Airport;;;;;;;;;
My next flight didn’t leave until six hours after I landed.;;;;;;;;;
Tahiti Airport is small and basic, and it’s all open-air before security. There were a few cafes, some uncomfortable chairs, a Polynesian drum circle at the entrance, and no power outlets. I’d planned on getting some work done at the airport, but it was so humid and noisy that I ended up sitting on Facebook until my battery ran out.;;;;;;;;;
Leg Two: Tahiti to Auckland;;;;;;;;;
I had to cross the International Date Line on my flight from Tahiti and so my five-hour flight arrived in New Zealand 29 hours after leaving.;;;;;;;;;
Stopover Two: Ten Hours in Auckland;;;;;;;;;
It was 11 p.m. in Auckland and my flight to Fiji was at 9 a.m., so I made the excellent decision to spend the night sleeping at the airport. It made sense at the time: airport hotels were expensive, and travelling into the city and back to stay somewhere cheaper felt like a waste of time. Given that I never manage to sleep when I need to wake up early for a flight anyway, I figured I might as well just stay where I was.;;;;;;;;;
I’m not sure I’ve ever been as cold as I was when sleeping on that floor.;;;;;;;;;
The icy air conditioning was on full blast and the floor was made of these weird tiles that refused to warm up, no matter how long I sat on them. After an hour of shivering, I took out every single item of clothing I had in my backpack and put them all on. Because I chase summer around the world and do everything I can to avoid winters, this was basically just t-shirts and shorts, with bikinis draped over me as a blanket.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
No matter what I did, I could not stop shivering.;;;;;;;;;
It was grim, I never managed to warm myself up, and I ended up trying to sleep on top of my backpack, which was about as comfortable as it sounds.;;;;;;;;;
I did not get any sleep that night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Leg Three: Auckland to Nadi;;;;;;;;;
It was time to go to Fiji!;;;;;;;;;
And here’s where I confess that this ridiculous travel day was sort-of partially my fault. You see, I’d originally booked two weeks in Fiji, so the flight from Bora Bora didn’t seem all that bad at the time.;;;;;;;;;
But I was exhausted. I’d been travelling around the South Pacific reasonably quickly over the past month and I’d realised I was dreading the rest of the trip. That’s never a good sign, so I decided to turn my planned time in Fiji to a quick layover and get myself to Mexico as quickly as possible. I had about a dozen friends currently living there, and Dave had just arrived in town, so nothing sounded more appealing than dumping my plans into the lagoon and jumping on the next flight over there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Stopover 3: 48 Hours in Nadi;;;;;;;;;
I gave myself a 48 hour layover in Nadi and I’m embarrassed to say I saw nothing.;;;;;;;;;
I came down with a cold on the flight to Nadi and I was unwell throughout my entire stay. I’d treated myself to a fancy resort stay in town and I’m so grateful I did, because I didn’t have to leave the walls of my sanctuary. I ate all of my meals there, I read books beside the pool, and I tried to sleep as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;
I’m disappointed I didn’t get a chance to see more than the slightest glimpse of Fiji, but I knew that if I’d forced myself outside to explore, I’d have ended up feeling worse.;;;;;;;;;
My priority had to be getting better as quickly as possible, because I had an awful flight coming up shortly.;;;;;;;;;
Leg Four: Nadi to Los Angeles;;;;;;;;;
Oh god.;;;;;;;;;
My eleven hour overnight flight to Los Angeles was horrendous, but it still wasn’t the worst flight I took on this jaunt.;;;;;;;;;
I left Nadi at 10 p.m. and arrived at Los Angeles at midday, local time. Overnight flights, man. They’re awful for sleep at the best of times, but my cold was rapidly turning into an ear infection and I spent much of the flight in agony.;;;;;;;;;
I landed in the U.S. exhausted, unbelievably jetlagged, and ready to just get to Oaxaca already to recover.;;;;;;;;;
This is the selfie I sent Dave when I arrived in L.A. So much life in my eyes!;;;;;;;;;
Stepover Four: Twelve Hours at LAX;;;;;;;;;
Not so fast!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My next flight left in twelve hours, at around midnight.;;;;;;;;;
What have I done? I wondered over and over and over that day.;;;;;;;;;
I felt like I was dying, but I didn’t feel like I had any option but to get on my flight. Sure, I could have cancelled it all, headed into the city, and stayed in a nice hotel until I recovered, but I really wanted to get to Mexico. I didn’t want to stretch out this travel day any further.;;;;;;;;;
It turned out that, yet again, LAX was all about the air conditioning. My options were to either try to sleep in the freezing cold terminal with flight announcements booming out every few minutes, or to sleep outside with all my bags, which didn’t really feel like the safest option.;;;;;;;;;
I balanced precariously on top of my backpack and fought as hard as I could to sleep.;;;;;;;;;
I failed.;;;;;;;;;
Leg Five: Los Angeles to Mexico City;;;;;;;;;
When I boarded my four hour flight to Mexico City, I had never felt so jetlagged before in my life. So tired. So drained. So awful.;;;;;;;;;
At this point, I had no idea that I had two ear infections and a sinus infection on top of not being able to sleep for 24+ hours, on top of being jetlagged as hell.;;;;;;;;;
Yes, a red eye flight was just what my body needed. A flight from midnight to 4 a.m. ;;;;;;;;;
Stopover Five: Six Hours in Mexico City;;;;;;;;;
As I stood in line for immigration, having not slept at all on the flight, I was convinced I was going to pass out. My head was pounding, my vision was blurry, my ears and face were full of pressure, and all I wanted was to be in Oaxaca.;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, this seemed to be a popular time for flights to arrive in Mexico City and I had to stand for over an hour until I reached the front of the queue. Several times, I almost called out for help, because I felt so close to fainting.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was a great sigh of relief that I made it through immigration without making anyone think I had zika and was finally in Mexico. With six hours until my next flight, I needed to find somewhere immediately to sleep. And I really didn’t care where.;;;;;;;;;
The quietest place I could find was a luggage scale at a row of check-in desks that weren’t being used. And guess what? Those luggage scales were freezing. Because of course they were.;;;;;;;;;
For the third time, I took all of my clothes out of my backpack, put everything on, and failed to sleep because I was trembling so violently.;;;;;;;;;
I would have cried, but I was too dehydrated to even produce tears.;;;;;;;;;
Leg Six: Mexico City to Oaxaca;;;;;;;;;
An hour-long flight to Oaxaca, a collectivo to the apartment Dave had found for us, an enormous hug, and the deepest sleep of my life.;;;;;;;;;
And then a trip to the doctor.;;;;;;;;;
Could I Have Done Anything Differently?;;;;;;;;;
This was one of the worst travel experiences of my life, but I’m not sure there was much I could have changed about it.;;;;;;;;;
I could have booked a flight to Los Angeles from Tahiti when I decided to cancel my Fiji trip, but the dates didn’t work out price-wise. It would have cost me $2000 to fly there direct and when you combined that with the $1000 I’d lose when I cancelled my flight via Nadi, I wasn’t going to throw away that much money.;;;;;;;;;
I could have cancelled my flight from Nadi to LA, or from LA to Mexico City, seen a doctor, and claimed the money back from my travel insurance, but at the time, I thought it was just a cold. I would have had to have proven to them that I wasn’t able to fly, and I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of making an insurance claim.;;;;;;;;;
In fact, the only thing I think I could have done differently (and wish I had done) was to book an airport hotel in Auckland, and to also book a hotel in Los Angeles for my twelve hours there.;;;;;;;;;
Travel is Glamorous;;;;;;;;;
I like to show the crappy side of travel because so many people have a vision of my life as being this perfect world where I flit from beautiful place to spectacular view. But the reality is, I have bad days just as much as I did when I wasn’t travelling — and in fact, they’re usually so much more worse when you travel, because you’re alone, you rarely speak the language, and getting from place to place can be ridiculously stressful. Plus, being sick while you travel is always the worst.;;;;;;;;;
So there you have it: the beautifully imperfect reality of my travels.;;;;;;;;;

If you need to fly from one specific airport to another specific airport on a specific day at a specific time, you’re going to struggle to pick up a bargain. The more constrained your limits are, the tougher it’s going to be to shop around. It’s going to be far easier to find a good deal if you’re able to modify your dates or locations in order to fit with price fluctuations. Here’s a few examples:;;;;;;;;;

Back in 2012, I wanted to fly from Saigon to Sydney, but one-way flights were coming in at around $700, which was over my budget. I decided to get flexible with my destination and used Skyscanner to search for one-way flights from Saigon to all of Australia. I spotted a $300 flight to Brisbane, where I rented a car for $100 and spent a week driving down the east coast. I saved a lot money and ended up seeing more of the country in the process — win-win!;;;;;;;;;
Another example is my recent trip to the South Pacific. I’d originally hoped to visit the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, but after pricing up flights and discovering I’d be up for $3,000 for a three-week-long island-hopping trip, I decided to research other destinations in the Pacific. My eventual itinerary took me to the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and Fiji and saved me over $2000 in the process!;;;;;;;;;
This has been the case over and over again on my travels. If you keep your dates and locations flexible, you’ll have so many more options for saving money.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re flexible on location: You can search for flights by country instead of city — the “United States” to “Thailand”, for example. If you were planning on starting your travels in Ching Mai, but discover it’s $200 cheaper to fly to Bangkok, it most likely won’t make all that much difference to your trip. You can also use Skyscanner to search for flights to “everywhere” if you’re open to heading anywhere in the world.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re flexible on dates: Sites like Skyscanner give you the option of searching for prices over an entire month or more. If you’re not fussed about what time of year you want to go away, you’ll be able to easily pick the cheapest date to fly.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re flexible on airports: Last month, I saved $80 on a flight by flying into an airport on the outskirts of Berlin rather than the one close to the city centre. That’s why you should be open to flying into the airports for low-cost carriers — even though they’re usually further away from the city, you’ll often be able to score a cheaper price. Public transport will then get you into city for a few dollars. ;;;;;;;;;
Flying over New Zealand is aways spectacular;;;;;;;;;
Check More Than One Website;;;;;;;;;
If you’re hunting for a bargain, don’t settle on the very first price you find! Instead, you should aim to check several flight aggregators, as some of them show deals the others haven’t picked up on.;;;;;;;;;

Skyscanner is my favourite flight comparison site and where I always head to first. It nearly always ends up finding the cheapest fares. I love the fact that you can search by country instead of city and across an entire month instead of a few days. One of Skyscanner’s most useful features is the ability to search for “everywhere” as a destination — great for if you’re not sure where to go next or are desperate to set off somewhere affordable for a quick trip.;;;;;;;;;
If Skyscanner doesn’t give me the price I’m looking for, next up on my list are:;;;;;;;;;

If You’re Under 26, Check Out STA Travel;;;;;;;;;
STA Travel offers super-cheap flights for students and travellers under 26. I ignored them when I first started travelling, because I thought it was a gimmick and the flights would just be more expensive than what I was finding anyway.;;;;;;;;;

The first time I checked them out was when I was too old to use them, and I discovered that basically every single flight I wanted to take would have been cheaper through them.;;;;;;;;;

If You Find A Price You’re Happy to Pay, Book It;;;;;;;;;
Oh man, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen a flight at a decent price, given it a few more days/weeks before booking, either through laziness or hoping the price will drop later on, and been screwed over.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Every single time I do this, I’ve ended up paying several hundred dollars more than the original price! If you find a flight that seems like a great deal, book it immediately rather than waiting to see if it drops further.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re like, six months out from taking the flight, though, you could sign up for fare alerts through Skyscanner. If the price drops below a certain amount, they’ll send you an email to let you know. I’ve done this a few times and it’s helped me pick up a bargain!;;;;;;;;;
Flying past Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
Always Use an Incognito Browser;;;;;;;;;
When you’re booking flights, make sure you open an incognito browser window when it’s time to make your purchase. I’ve seen prices gradually increase for flights as I kept checking them, only to open an incognito window and have them drop. It’s definitely worth doing this when you’re ready to pay. It’s not a myth — I’ve had this happen to me plenty of times!;;;;;;;;;

If You’re Struggling to Find Anything, Try Small Low-Cost Airlines;;;;;;;;;
If you’re not having much luck with flight aggregators, it’s worth checking out the websites of some of the regions’s low-cost airlines, as a few of these aren’t included in flight aggregators’ results. A good place to start is this massive Wikipedia list of budget airlines.;;;;;;;;;
When I was in French Polynesia, I managed to score seven flights for $400 through Air Tahiti, which you won’t find on any of the sites mentioned in the this post — they aren’t even included on Skyscanner! You have to buy them direct.;;;;;;;;;

For Complicated Trips, FlightFox is the Way;;;;;;;;;
FlightFox connects you to a flight-searching expert, who hunts around to find you the best possible deal. You’ll tell them where you want to go, when, the lowest price you’ve found so far, and how flexible you are, and they guarantee to find a better price or your money back. This is definitely worth trying out if you’re planning a round-the-world trip or an adventure that involves many stopovers.;;;;;;;;;

Secret Flying is My Secret Weapon;;;;;;;;;
The vast majority of the flights I’ve booked over the past couple of years are deals I’ve discovered through Secret Flying. Here are some examples of the deals I’ve found through that site:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
London to Los Angeles for $120;;;;;;;;;
Singapore to London for $160;;;;;;;;;
Rome to Tokyo for $350 return;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon to Cape Town for $350 return;;;;;;;;;
London to New Delhi for $300 return;;;;;;;;;
London to Dar es Salaam to Kigali to London for $450;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The deals the Secret Flying team are unbelievable, and I can’t stop checking their site. It’s totally free to use, too. These days, if I’m unsure of where to visit next, I’ll pull up Secret Flying and see what deals are going on.;;;;;;;;;
The vast majority of the deals shared on this site are return flights, so this is one for those of you with a fixed address rather than nomadic travellers wanting to travel one-way.;;;;;;;;;
Avoid Flying On Popular Dates;;;;;;;;;
The are certain dates that are always going to be crazy-expensive regardless of when you book your flights. Times of year like during the school holidays, around popular festivals/events, and over the weekends. That’s why Christmas Day and New Years Day are some of the cheapest days to fly — so few people want to travel on those days!;;;;;;;;;
Look to book flights that depart mid-week, because most people want to fly out on a Friday and back on a Sunday.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;

I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue rounding up my travels in this way, so hit the pause button for several months to reevaluate. As it turns out, I missed them! And so did you guys. Stay tuned as I’ll be catching you up on every detail of my recent moves over the next few weeks or so!";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Month 55 brought about a blend of some of my favourite ways to travel: solo; on beautiful islands; and stopping moving to get to know a city in depth.;;;;;;;
I kicked off the month in beautiful Maupiti, which I chose to visit solely because I’d read it was just like Bora Bora had been in the sixties. I knew I’d be visiting Bora Bora while I was in French Polynesia and wasn’t sure just how damaged by tourism it would be. Seeing Maupiti first would help to give me some idea.;;;;;;;;;
I loved my time on this laidback island and wished I’d had longer to explore. When it came time to get to know the island better, I had just one full day to do so and two options for seeing it: by land, opting to climb the volcano at the centre of the island and then walk the circumference afterwards; or by sea, hopping on a cruise of the lagoon to snorkel with manta rays and gaze at the vibrant coral.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I went with the former because I’d sworn myself off snorkelling trips just a week earlier. I think I made the right decision, but I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of regret when I saw the photos my friends got from their trip. They got to swim with over a dozen manta rays for their hour in the water!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From Maupiti, I moved on to Raiatea and learned that sometimes the weather just doesn’t cooperate with your plans.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It rained pretty much constantly while I was on the island, putting to rest any plans I had to climb volcanoes or day trip over to the island of Tahaa, but I found a positive in the thunderstorms and spent my time reading and listening to the rain. It’s always nice to work in an unexpected rest day into your travels!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After one great island and one not-so-great experience on Raiatea, I had mixed feelings about French Polynesia and wasn’t sure if I liked it or not.;;;;;;;;;
Well, it took mere minutes from me landing in Huahine to realise I love this island territory.;;;;;;;;;
Huahine was everything I wanted from a paradise island: it was affordable, the locals were friendly, there were tons of things to keep you busy, it had a fascinating history, and was home to one of the best beaches I’ve ever been on.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then, the big finale. Visiting Bora Bora on a budget was one of the main inspirations for my trip through the South Pacific, but I was still surprised by how much I loved it.;;;;;;;;;
I thought it would be ruined by tourists, but it wasn’t. I thought it would be insanely expensive, but it wasn’t. I thought it wouldn’t be as pretty as the photos you see of it online, but it was. My only disappointment was that I wasn’t there with Dave! It was definitely a bit weird to be there as a solo traveller.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d originally booked two weeks of island hopping around the Yasawa Islands in Fiji for my next South Pacific country, but decided to cancel my stay at the last minute. I was tired, I was feeling islanded out, I was lonely from so much solo travel time, and knowing that I had so many friends in Mexico, where Dave currently was, helped me pull the trigger.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Sometimes you have to make decisions that favour your happiness over travel, and this was one of those situations where I knew I wouldn’t make the most of Fiji if I tried to stick it out. There’ll always be 2017, when I’ll next be in the region!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After the travel day from hell (five days of travel, three nights spent on cold airport floors, many methods of transportation, and a ear and sinus infection combo), I was back in Mexico and so happy to be there.;;;;;;;;;
My stint in Oaxaca had been a long time coming. Dave and I had originally planned to spend a full month living there when we were last in Mexico, but had cancelled those plans after a particularly cold winter had us craving the beach instead.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We were finally here and we were ready to eat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’m not ashamed to confess that I spent the vast majority of the next two weeks eating and drinking my way around the city. Oaxaca made for a perfect base as I attempted to nurse the infections out of me and fight my way back to health. It was incredibly inexpensive, the food was amazing, and the company was even better.;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t expecting Oaxaca to make it onto my shortlist of places I’d like to live in one day, but it totally does.;;;;;;;;;
The only downside was the altitude, which kicked my ass every single time I walked anywhere!;;;;;;;;;

I sometimes have these moments when I travel where everything slots into place. Moments when I cast my mind back to five years ago and remind myself how terrified I was to travel — how I used to sit for hours and daydream about what it would be like and praying that I would have nothing but amazing experiences.;;;;;;;;;
Exploring Huahine was one of those experiences that would have blown my five-years-ago self’s mind. Wobbling along empty roads on a beaten-up bicycle, calling out bonjour! to friendly locals, taking detours to feed some sacred blue-eyed eels, and snapchatting my way around the island without realising I had a giant smear of mud across my face. I felt so free and alive that day, like I was exactly where I was supposed to be.;;;;;;;;;
Reuniting with Dave in Oaxaca after spending a month apart came in at a close second, though :-);;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
No surprises here! I suffered so much on my crazy-long travel day that I wrote a post about it.;;;;;;;;;
There were a couple of other challenges to deal with this month, too: getting sick with so many infections meant that I spent much of my time in Oaxaca feeling dizzy and in pain and I was sad that I didn’t get to explore Raiatea due to bad weather, but they were mild downsides in the grand scheme of things.;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
It has to be having my guesthouse owner in Maupiti lose my booking! When I rocked up to the jetty on the main island and discovered nobody waiting for me, I started to get nervous but remained optimistic. Half an hour later, I wasn’t feeling quite so confident.;;;;;;;;;
When a local spotted me looking lost and called my guesthouse for me, I thought that everything was going to be okay. Not so fast! My guesthouse owner greeted me with the horrifying news that she’d lost my booking and was fully booked during my stay.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, these things have a way of working themselves out, and due to my original guesthouse’s incompetence, I scored a stay at a much nicer place for a far cheaper price than they usually charge. After a stressful morning, it was a pretty great consolation prize.;;;;;;;;;
Instagram of the Month;;;;;;;;;
This was a good month for Instagram! My post about my travel expenses for 2015 went viral and I received a whole lot of press around the world for it — my expenses were featured in articles in the UK, Italy, Moldova, Slovakia, Finland, and more! I was stoked with the coverage I received, and because many of the articles just grabbed photos from my Instagram for their article, my followers on Instagram grew substantially this month.;;;;;;;;;

My best photo was of Aitutaki, which racked up a whopping 1,244 likes (although to be fair, I posted the photo over six months ago, so I’m sure it didn’t have that many at the time!). Thanks, as always, for all of your likes and comments on my photos! I’m thrilled to I see I’m receiving as much love as people with well over 10x the number of followers I have. Yay!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
After such a fast-paced trip around the South Pacific, I’m relieved to now have a full month to recover in Oaxaca. The next two weeks will be delightfully low-key, spent lingering over long lunches with travel blogging friends, attempting to eat my entire body weight in tacos, sampling the many different mezcals the city has to offer, recovering from my various ailments, and catching up on blog work.;;;;;;;;;

But, as always when we’re in Mexico, I suspect we’ll most likely spend all of our time eating.;;;;;;;;;
"After Oaxaca, it’ll be time for a change of scene once again, as Dave and I hope on a plane to our beloved Pacific Northwest for a month of housesitting in Seattle for friends.

I’ve never been to Paris. I’ve never been to Berlin. I’ve never been to Greece. So I decided to spend a month hitting up all three to find out what I’d been missing out on.;;;;;;;;;
And then when I spotted a flight that would take me from Preveza, in Greece, to Berlin via Venice, I locked that shit down. Because Venice was yet another European oversight of mine, so why not cram it into my trip? I’d have a seven-hour layover with which to explore the city, and I was determined to do it justice while also not missing my onward flight.;;;;;;;;;
And fun fact: this would be my first time ever at taking advantage of a short layover in a city. I’m usually either too nervous I’ll miss my flight or I’ll realise I have so much I want to see that I extend my stopover to several days.;;;;;;;;;
The Grand Canal;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, layovering in Venice is easy to do, and despite my fiercely-held beliefs that I was going to miss my flight to Berlin, it ended up being a hassle-free experience and gave me an enjoyable first glimpse of the city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting to Venice From the Airport;;;;;;;;;
Venice’s airport has a left luggage section just outside of arrivals, which will make any layover immediately much easier. At just €6 for 24 hours, it’s a bargain! I left my backpack and brought with me my camera, phone, and money for the day.;;;;;;;;;
From outside the left luggage area, you can then hop on an ATVO Venezia Express bus that takes you to Piazzale Roma, which comes in at €15 for a round-trip ride. Buses head from and to the airport every half an hour, so you’ll never have to wait long for one.;;;;;;;;;
From Piazzale Roma, you can then either walk into the more tourist parts of Venice (it’s a 25 minute walk to get to St Mark’s Square), but I decided to hop on a vaporetto (water bus) instead. The Linea Uno (No. 1) vaporetto runs from Piazzale Roma along the length of the Grand Canal and costs €7,50 for a single journey.;;;;;;;;;
Gondola rides are crazy-expensive (around €80 for a 40-minute ride) in Venice, and I would have also felt like a loner if I’d taken one on my own. The water buses, though, give you a similar experience at a much more affordable price. You still get to see Venice from the water, and if you manage to get to the front of the queue while you wait for the vaporetto, you’ll be able to nab a front row seat outside, where you can clearly see all of the action.;;;;;;;;;
Venice from the vaporetto;;;;;;;;;
And it was on this journey that I fell in love with Venice.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent my entire vaporetto ride berating myself for having never been there before, wondering why nobody had insisted that I visit, and even thinking about how I would totally have my honeymoon there.;;;;;;;;;
Venice was easily one of the prettiest places I’ve ever visited.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, God, the Tourists;;;;;;;;;
I stayed on the water bus until Sant’Elena, then dawdled my way back towards Piazza San Marco (St Mark’s Square), wandering down narrow alleyways and gazing up at the colourful buildings. I was falling more and more in love with Venice with every step.;;;;;;;;;
And then, when I finally reached Piazza San Marco, I was greeted with scenes like these.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Big yikes.;;;;;;;;;
And suddenly Venice wasn’t quite so wonderful anymore.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So here’s the thing: I’d heard that Venice was crazy-chaotic in the summer months, but this was a random Tuesday in September, when all the kids were back in school. I really hadn’t expected it to be quite so busy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At least it didn’t smell of pee, though.;;;;;;;;;
Getting My Tourist On Regardless;;;;;;;;;
But, of course, I can’t complain about there being tourists in Venice when I was also a tourist, so I pretended the crowds weren’t there and set about seeing as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;
I fought my way through St Mark’s Square, checking out Doge’s Palace, the opulent St. Mark’s Basilica, and the campanile. Unfortunately, I had to admire them from the outside, because the queues were stretching back a hundred metres and I wanted to make sure I had time to see everything else.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wandered across to the Bridge of Sighs, which was beautiful. The bridge connects Doge’s Palace with its prison, and on that bridge was where many criminals took their last glimpse of Venice before being locked up.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t come to Venice and not sample some of the gelato, so I hopped online to google “best gelato venice”, and made my way over to Gelato Fantasy. I went for the strawberry cheesecake, and was it the best in Venice? Well, it was definitely the best I’ve ever tried.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then I was all about getting lost. I had a couple of hours left before I’d have to make my way back to the airport, so I decided to spend them wandering down tiny alleyways and snapping photos of the picturesque canals.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And it was during this walk that I started to fall a little bit back in love with Venice. Away from the crowds, it can be so wonderful — it’s just really hard to escape them for more than a few minutes at a time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My First Impressions of Venice;;;;;;;;;
I have mixed feelings about my first visit to Venice.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I was cruising along on the water, I absolutely adored it. I was making plans to visit every year, I couldn’t stop taking photos, and I was even placing it above Ljubljana as the prettiest city in Europe.;;;;;;;;;
But as soon as I left the water, I struggled. There were just so. many. people. that it was probably one of the most crowded place I’ve ever been to. I hate crowds, and I especially hate crowds that are that large.;;;;;;;;;
So it’s a bit of a love-hate relationship for me. I’m glad I visited, and I’m sure I’ll return at some point in the future, but yeah.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There were simply too many people for me to fully enjoy my time there.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
"Have you ever been to Venice? Was it that ridiculously crowded when you visited?""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408022-407,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/18"",""Stranded and Afraid in Maupiti"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/stranded-and-afraid-in-maupiti/"",""Stranded and Afraid in Maupiti"",""July 17, 2018"",""Something was wrong.";;;;;;;;;
I had just landed in Maupiti and as far as I could tell, my airport pickup wasn’t here.;;;;;;;;;
In most parts of the world, this wouldn’t be much of a problem. I’d jump online to research how to get to my guesthouse using public transport or, if that wasn’t an option, grab a taxi to wherever I needed to go.;;;;;;;;;
In Maupiti, however, it wouldn’t be quite so easy. Because the main island is essentially a giant volcano with little flat ground, Maupiti’s airport is located on a small strip of land on the outskirts of its lagoon. There isn’t much of anything there: no roads, no accommodation, no restaurants, nothing. To get to your guesthouse, you needed to travel across the water by boat.;;;;;;;;;
A boat that was owned by your guesthouse owners.;;;;;;;;;
Your guesthouse owners who were supposed to be here to pick you up.;;;;;;;;;
After grabbing my luggage from one of the wooden benches that served as a baggage reclaim, I had begun my search for said guesthouse owners. I’d wandered around in circles for several minutes, hopefully scanning every hand-written sign, watching as the eight other people on my flight were met with hugs and fragrant flower leis then led towards a small line of boats. One by one, the owners had kicked their engines into gear, then roared off across the pristine turquoise waters and out of sight.;;;;;;;;;
With a sigh, I turned back towards the airport, although to call it an airport felt like an exaggeration. In front of me was a tiny open-air shelter with just one check-in desk and a couple of benches.;;;;;;;;;
And it was then that I realised the only people remaining on this island seemed to be the handful of tourists that were lining up for the next flight.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A teenage boy sauntered up to me from behind a tree and said something in French.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“English?” I asked hopefully.;;;;;;;;;
He shook his head and looked deep in thought. “You okay?”;;;;;;;;;
I shook my head back at him. “My pension owner — not here.”;;;;;;;;;
He asked for the name of my guesthouse, then looked around as I had done, frowning when he realised the owner wasn’t there. It wasn’t hard to see; there was now nobody in sight.;;;;;;;;
“Air Tahiti transfer,” he suddenly announced, leading me towards a small ferry. “Guesthouse there.”;;;;;;;;;
He pointed at the main island and nodded.;;;;;;;;;
I thanked him and clambered aboard, telling myself that this was exactly what I was supposed to be doing, but not really believing it. If I’d needed to take an Air Tahiti shuttle, wouldn’t my guesthouse owner have told me that in advance? ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We moored and I climbed up onto dry land. The other couple stepped up to join me and were greeted by their guesthouse owner.;;;;;;;;;
“Pension Tereia?” I asked hopefully, but he shook his head.;;;;;;;;;
With a shrug, I grabbed my bag and made my way to the main road; the only road on the island.;;;;;;;;
“They’re probably just late,” I whispered to myself. I’d read so many articles about the importance of optimism; that people who are pessimistic tend to attract bad luck, and although reading anything about *energy* or *laws of attraction* makes me want to cover myself in slugs, by this point, I’ll try anything.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Everything will be okay, I reminded myself. Everything always works out okay. I’m still alive, after all. ;;;;;;;;;
I dropped my backpack by the side of the road and sat down on it. While I waited, I grabbed my phone in the hope there’d be an open Wi-Fi network, but there was nothing I could access.;;;;;;;;;
A blonde girl was sat fifty feet away from me with a backpack, which gave me hope that someone was coming for me.;;;;;;;;;
Surely somebody had to be coming for me? ;;;;;;;;;
The one thing that struck me was the silence. It was unnerving. There were no engines, no music, no conversations, nothing to indicate there was any life on the island. Just the sound of the wind and the crunching of gravel beneath my flip-flops.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My ears pricked up as I heard the distant rumble of an engine. It was going to be okay! ;;;;;;;;;
When I saw a pickup truck turn the corner and slow down to meet me, I stood up, my shoulders dropping when I realised he was here for me.;;;;;;;;;
“Bonjour!” I called to the man.;;;;;;;;;
“Bonjour Anna!” he called back.;;;;;;;;;
Oh.;;;;;;;;;
The girl who had been waiting nearby jumped up, slung her bag over her shoulders, and jumped in the passenger seat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I sat back down on my backpack and watched them disappear around a corner. I was alone again.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t hear anything, see anyone, do anything. Maupiti is a tiny island of around 1,000 residents, most of whom have no need to speak any English. There aren’t any taxis and I didn’t have a map. I had no idea how to get to my guesthouse, or indeed any guesthouse.;;;;;;;;;
I was stranded.;;;;;;;;;
So what did I do to get myself out of this situation?;;;;;;;;;
Cried, mostly.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A group of local men wandered up from behind and one of them uttered something in French to me.;;;;;;;;;
“English?” I asked nervously, crossing my fingers tightly by my side.;;;;;;;;;
They frowned, but one of them stepped forward. “All okay?”;;;;;;;;;
I shook my head. “Pension Tereia? They should be here. A pickup?”;;;;;;;;;
He looked confused and spoke to the other guys for a few minutes. Eventually, he pulled out his phone and started talking on it. I allowed my shoulders to relax slightly. This was a good sign.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“They will come for you,” he told me, pocketing his phone with a smile.;;;;;;;;;
I thanked the men profusely, over and over and over and over and over. Because god knows what I would have done if they hadn’t stopped to help me out.;;;;;;;;;
I waited alone on my backpack for twenty minutes until a pickup truck pulled up by the side of the road. There were two blonde girls inside. They didn’t speak any English, but they helped me into the back of their truck with my backpack and we slowly made our way around the island.;;;;;;;;;
I let out a sigh and unfurled my fingers. Maybe, just maybe, everything was going to be okay.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Lauren!” a voice cried out, and I watched as a plump woman rushed across her garden to meet me in the driveway.;;;;;;;;;
“Bonjour!” I called back to her with a grin, immediately forgetting everything that had gone wrong before.;;;;;;;;;
It was all going to be okay. I was here now. I was in Maupiti.;;;;;;;;;
“I am so very sorry,” she said, a look of concern etched across her face.;;;;;;;;;
“Oh no, it’s okay,” I said, waving my hands dismissively. “I got here eventually! Don’t worry about it.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“But we are fully booked,” she continued.;;;;;;;;;
My smiled dropped.;;;;;;;;;
“I do not know what happened but I lost your booking. We do not have any beds for you.”;;;;;;;;;
“But…” I bit my bottom lip to stop it trembling.;;;;;;;;;
A bird squawked overhead and I craned my neck to see if I could spot it. I needed a distraction to keep me from crying. All around me was jungle — I couldn’t see a single building. How was I going to find somewhere else to stay?;;;;;;;;;
The owner placed her hand on my back and walked me back to the pickup truck. I clambered back up to sit with my backpack, unable to utter a single word.;;;;;;;;;
“I am sorry” she said once more, and we started back the way we’d come.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Ten agonising minutes later, we turned into a driveway and stopped. One of the girls turned around in her seat and motioned for me to climb off the back. They both helped me lift my backpack up onto my shoulders, then pointed at the building in front of me and waved their goodbyes.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“This is so weird,” I mumbled to myself, before taking a deep breath and stepping inside the house.;;;;;;;;;
“You speak French?” a teenage guy yelled at from the sofa. At least he seemed to be expecting me. ;;;;;;;;;
“A little,” I lied.;;;;;;;;;
He took my bag from my back and led me into a small bedroom. There was a giant cagelike mosquito net contraption over the bed that looked like a cake topper and a ceiling fan spun uselessly overhead.;;;;;;;;;
“Goodbye,” the guy said cheerfully and shut the door behind him.;;;;;;;;;
I had no idea where I was.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t know what the name of this guesthouse was; or if it even was a guesthouse. I didn’t know where on the island it was. And — most terrifyingly of all — I had no idea how much it would cost to stay here.;;;;;;;;
Because I’d only spent 12 hours in Tahiti, I had only managed to withdraw $300 in cash to pay for my stay in Maupiti. The island didn’t have a single ATM and everything I’d read online said that the guesthouses didn’t have card readers. If my stay ended up totalling more than $300, I was going to be very, very screwed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If there’s one thing my dozens of travel disasters have taught me over the years, it’s that everything has a way of working itself out in the end. This situation was no different.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t run out of cash, because the owners of my new guesthouse charged me the original amount I was supposed to pay at the guesthouse that lost my booking. The guesthouse I ended up in was lovely. I made friends and the owners were kind. It was far nicer than the one I originally booked and bonus: it was located right on the only public beach on the island. I spent the rest of my time in Maupiti climbing mountains and avoiding rain; passing the time blissfully incident-free.;;;;;;;;
The journey to get there, it turned out, was just another travel disaster to add to my list; another ridiculous story to tell friends; another reason to remain optimistic.;;;;;;;
Everything works itself out in the end.;;;;;;;;;

It’s my most travelled continent — I’ve been to thirty-two European countries at last count — but the vast majority of my experiences have been limited to capital cities. Take a look at where I’ve been: when you reach Europe, the amount of destinations per country drastically drops!;;;;;;;;;
It’s not that I don’t want to explore more of the places I visit in Europe; I just get so excited by the opportunities the region can offer. Eurail passes make it easy to explore, and my 2012 trip saw me hitting up twelve countries in six weeks, because if you have near-unlimited travel for a month, why not try to see as much as possible? I’d like to say I’ve learned my lesson about travelling too fast (the reality is: you almost always end up exhausted and seeing very little!), but my Baltics/Scandinavia jaunt earlier this year had me visiting six new countries in two weeks.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Still, despite occasionally giving in to my wanderlust and booking fast-paced trips that I eventually grow to regret, I’m proud of my three week trip to the Netherlands this year.;;;;;;;;;
There was so much temptation! And I can’t deny I tried to work in a side trip to Luxembourg or Belgium or Germany, but for once, I committed to exploring a European country in depth.;;;;;;;;;
Why the Netherlands? Amsterdam is a city both Dave and I adore and we usually pay it a visit once a year. With Dave’s brother living there and more of our friends opting to make it home, we never need much of an excuse to pay this beautiful city a visit. But that was also the problem: I’d visited four times and had yet to leave Amsterdam!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s why I’m so happy we chose to explore more of the Netherlands:;;;;;;;;;
It’s compact: Long travel days can be a pain in the ass, so it was refreshing to not have to travel for half a day or more to reach my next destination. Our longest travel day was from Maastricht to the Hague, which came in at two-and-a-half hours. It was such a novelty not to have to write off an entire day due to travel!;;;;;;;;;
Travel is cheap: For a Western European country with incredibly expensive accommodation, I was surprised at how affordable our transportation costs worked out to be. Utrecht to Leiden totalled 5 euros, and Leiden to Maastricht cost us around 20 euros.;;;;;;;;;
It’s so easy: In the Netherlands, 98% of the locals we encountered spoke English and went out of their way to help us out. Everything was well-signposted so we never got lost. The train system was so modern and everything was on time — we even had a local apologise to us for the complicated ticket machines when we asked for help at a train station. They weren’t complicated; we were just being stupid. It was a breath of fresh air to not have to worry about something going wrong.;;;;;;;;
I had a fabulous three weeks there. Here’s how it went!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Underrated Utrecht;;;;;;;;;
What an underrated city! I loved Utrecht, and its location — just a 25-minute train ride from Amsterdam — makes it the perfect destination for a day trip or weekend getaway. We stayed for four nights.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I can’t talk about our stay in this cute city without mentioning our accommodation. When I saw a houseboat up for rent on Airbnb, I dropped the owner a message before you could say but don’t you get motion sickness? Our boat was surprisingly warm, surprisingly spacious, and had me wondering how I could ever leave. It didn’t make me feel sick! Waking up to this view also didn’t hurt:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
During our four day stint, I fell in love with Utrecht’s arty, student vibe. One of my favourite aspects of European travel is the cafe culture, so I was excited to find so many of them clustered around squares and alongside canals. Utrecht is an incredibly walkable city, too, which gives you the perfect excuse to break up the day’s explorations with a cup of tea and some people watching.;;;;;;;;;
I loved how quiet the city is, too! Utrecht is the smallest of the big four cities in the Netherlands and you could tell: it had a small town feel but with all of the amenities you’d find in a big city. Best of all, it’s not on very many tourists’ radars, so it doesn’t have anything like the crowds of people that Amsterdam does. And because the red light district is located several miles outside of the centre, it means that Utrecht is less about drunken stag nights and more about lingering over coffees/beers.;;;;;;;;;
I’d love to tell you that I did dozens of touristy things in Utrecht, but the truth is, our time there was all about recovery and rest. We didn’t climb to the top of the Dom Tower to get a panoramic view of the city; instead, we bought a bottle of wine, some olives, bread and cheese from a local shop and sat on the deck of our boat each afternoon, snacking, listening to music, drinking, and sunbathing.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The one thing I made sure to do every day? Wander around the medieval old town (Utrecht has the country’s oldest one!), stopping along the way for a drink at the bars. Then later, strolling alongside the canals. Utrecht has such a laid-back atmosphere, which helped make it the perfect start to my trip.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Stopping to Smell the Flowers in Leiden;;;;;;;;;
I knew I couldn’t spend time in the Netherlands without paying a visit to the tulips at Keukenhof Gardens, so we travelled from Utrecht to Leiden, another student city, filled with even more bars and restaurants for us to sun ourselves at. Yep, I was definitely making the most of having my book over and done with.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Though we were in Leiden to see the tulips, I struggled to work up the motivation to leave the canals. There were too many bars to hop to, too much raspberry-flavoured beer to savour, too much bitterballen to snack on. So, for three glorious days, we sat in the sunshine and indulged. Each morning, we’d wake up and head out to Bagels & Beans for a bagel tapas breakfast, spend our morning sunbathing on the grassy patch close to the windmill in the photo above (what a Dutch scene!), and our afternoons drinking beside the canals.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was in danger of spending all of my time in the Netherlands eating and drinking, so on our final day, we made it to the tulips.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And they were so, so colourful. And beautiful. But to be honest, it was a bit like walking around in a giant garden and I wasn’t that impressed. It’s definitely worth seeing once in your lifetime, that’s for certain, but more than that? I’d likely pass.;;;;;;;;;

A Different Side of the Netherlands in Maastricht;;;;;;;;;
It took just a few minutes of research before I decided on Maastricht as the next destination for me. It sounded so different to the rest of the country!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maastricht is a bit of an oddity. I’d call it a melting pot but then I’d have to slap myself for using such a tired cliche. Its location, way down in the south, and its close proximity to Belgium (2 miles) and Germany (20 miles) have resulted in an interesting mix of food, culture, language, and architecture that I didn’t see anywhere else in the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;
And I love that Dave went for an afternoon run to a new country and back while we were there!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The first thing I noticed was the difference in the architecture. In Maastricht, smaller, wider houses were favoured over the long and skinny design you’ll find in much of the country. The food was different, too, with a focus on game meat, extremely thick fries, and delicious Limburger cheese. Even the language changes this far south, with many of the residents opting to speak Limburgish (a blend of German and Dutch) rather than outright Dutch. And then, several locals told me they identify more as Belgian than Dutch!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Landscape-wise, much of the city is based around the river pictured above, rather than a network of canals, but most shockingly of all: there are hills!;;;;;;;;;
Maastricht is also home to some delicious burgers and fries at Cafe Falstaff, and we may have had dinner there almost every night of our stay.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Fun fact: Maastricht is the birthplace of the European Union, European citizenship, and the euro!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my highlights of our stay was the running tour we signed up for through Maastricht Running Tours. I was terrified by the concept of a running tour, so much so that I almost cancelled our booking at the last minute. I’m so glad I didn’t, though, as I discovered an exhilarating new way to get to know a city!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And while challenging for someone who had the fitness levels of a dead badger, our guide was patient, encouraging, and helped us understand the city from a local’s perspective. I highly recommend it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of the places I visited in the Netherlands, I think I liked Maastricht the most. I loved the big squares that were lined with bars and cafes. I loved waking up and heading to a bakery for breakfast, then walking to the river to eat beside it. I especially loved Maastricht’s gorgeous bookstore.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

Mishaps and Museums in the Hague;;;;;;;;;
We had just arrived in the Hague. In front of us was some kind of art exhibition and the pathway was lined with sculptures. I found one that looked like a jail cell with a coin slot in front of the bars.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Oooh,” I gasped at Dave. “I want to go inside!”;;;;;;;;;
I grabbed a euro and dropped it into the slot.;;;;;;;;;
Nothing happened.;;;;;;;;;
I waited.;;;;;;;;;
Nothing.;;;;;;;;;
“Well, that was dumb,” I muttered.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Hague and I got off on the wrong foot and I struggled to warm to it throughout my visit. I decided to visit because I’d heard that, like Maastricht, it wouldn’t feel like anywhere else I had visited in the Netherlands. And that was true: it felt like a modern city, it was within biking distance of the sea, and there were very few canals.;;;;;;;;;
And maybe it was because the weather transformed from sunny skies to drizzly days, but it all felt a little bit bleak. I tried my best to make the most of it and wandered around the centre for a few hours each day, but I just wasn’t connecting to the city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that was my three week trip to the Netherlands! What an amazing country, and I’m so glad I got to see a side of it that was far away from the Amsterdam stereotypes!;;;;;;;;;

They’re typically rife with scams, a little confusing to get through, and often, something seems to go wrong when I’m involved in them.;;;;;;;;;
There was also, of course, the time my minivan drove off and left me at the Thai-Burma border. There was the fact that I’ve had to pay a bribe every single time I’ve entered Cambodia. There was the time Dave tried to exit Malaysia on his New Zealand passport and enter Thailand on his British one and was refused entry into Thailand.;;;;;;;;;
It’s a frustrating but necessary part of travel.;;;;;;;;;
And Central American borders, I’d read, can be particularly sketchy.;;;;;;;;;
Sunset in El Remate, Guatemala;;;;;;;;;
We’d only spent two days in Belize by this point, and had filled them with butterflies and ruins. We’d barely even had enough time to get a feel for San Ignacio, let alone the entire country, and already we were leaving. There was no reason for me to sad though, like I usually am, because we would only be in Guatemala for the next 48 hours.;;;;;;;;;
Why such a short visit?;;;;;;;;;
Tikal was calling our names.;;;;;;;;;
Arguably the most famous of Mayan ruins, Tikal is roughly 100km into the northern part of Guatemala. From San Ignacio, you have two options for seeing it: the first is to spend a ridiculous amount of money (around $150) to do it as a day trip. You’ll end up spending seven hours sat on a bus getting there and back, and a few hours exploring the ruins. The second option is to do it yourself, saving a ton of money in the process, while also spending a few days in Guatemala, and actually getting to witness the sunrise at Tikal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We, of course, chose the latter.;;;;;;;;;
Butterfly at the Cahal Pech ruins in Belize;;;;;;;;;
Getting from San Ignacio to the border was simple: we jumped in a cab (complete with cracked windscreen and friendly driver who spent more time telling stories and looking at us rather than on the road) from the centre of town, and paid the driver B$10 to take us the eight miles to Guatemala.;;;;;;;;;
We’d not had the best border crossing from Mexico to Belize a few days earlier, with an attempted scam on the Mexico side that we’d artfully avoided and an intense questioning session from immigration as we’d entered Belize. We’d done our research on the Belize-Guatemala border, though, and had read there would be various attempts at bribes as we passed across.;;;;;;;;;
We made it out of Belize without a hitch, but it was when we crossed the river and reached the Guatemalan side that we ran into problems.;;;;;;;;;
The immigration official fiddled with our passports for a few seconds, flicking to the photo pages and holding them up beside our faces. Then he looked at Dave.;;;;;;;;;
“You need to pay the entry fee.”;;;;;;;;;
“What entry fee?” Dave asked.;;;;;;;;;
“Entry to Guatemala. Twenty quetzales.”;;;;;;;;;
Twenty Guatemalan quetzales is just over 2.50 U.S. dollars, so we weren’t exactly put out about having to pay it. But Dave has this thing about bribes. Well, to be more accurate, he has this thing about fairness. If something isn’t fair, he can’t rest until he does something about it.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“There’s an entrance fee?” he shot back. “I didn’t think there was one?”;;;;;;;;;
“Yes. Twenty quetzales entrance fee to Guatemala.”;;;;;;;;;
“Okay, well can we get a receipt for this payment then please?”;;;;;;;;;
We’d tried this particular trick before in Southeast Asia when we knew we were being bribed by an immigration guy. We’d ask for a receipt because we knew it wasn’t an official fee and they wouldn’t be able to give us one. Usually they’d just say no and then we’d end up paying the bribe anyway, because we still wanted to get into the country.;;;;;;;;;
In Guatemala, though, something quite different happened.;;;;;;;;;
The guy took a deep breath and stared at his feet. He shook his head a few times and then quickly stamped our passports. We took them from his outstretched hand.;;;;;;;;;
“No need to pay,” he told us. “Welcome to Guatemala.”;;;;;;;;;
"And that was, without a doubt, the most terrible attempt at a bribe I’ve ever seen.""";;;;;;;;;

You can read that post here if you’d like.";;;;;;;;;
I’m all about New Years resolutions, even though deep inside I know that the first of the year is just an arbitrary date and you should never wait to make the changes you’re dreaming of. But fresh starts are exciting nonetheless, so I always take the time to plan out twenty things I’d like to achieve each year.;;;;;;;;;
At the start of 2016, I guessed my themes for the coming 12 months would be change, experimentation, and stopping.;;;;;;;;;
In reality, it ended up being incrementalism.;;;;;;;;;
Baby steps. ;;;;;;;;;
I’ve always been someone who craves immediacy. Someone who gives up if it looks like they’re going to fail. If something seems too hard. If I can’t get the hang of it within a few weeks. If I can’t see progress. ;;;;;;;;;
This year, I had to take a giant shuffle back and embrace the concept of slow and steady. To learn that I can achieve almost anything as long as I take baby steps. ;;;;;;;;;
If I want to be able to do 100 push ups without stopping, I can do it. All I need to do is get on the ground and make myself do as many as possible each and every day. If I don’t give up, I’ll get there eventually — almost anyone will — whether it takes six months or two years. ;;;;;;;;;
If I want the positive effects of meditation, I’ll have to fight through three months where it feels like it’s doing nothing before it all fits into place. ;;;;;;;;;
It’s so simple, right? You can achieve almost anything if you take small, consistent steps towards your goal. I don’t know why I’d never sat down and really thought about it. But having that reminder with me at all times has pushed me to achieve so much more than I expected.;;;;;;;;;
So 2016 was the year of not giving up.;;;;;;;;;
I thought I set myself some ambitious goals for the year, and now looking back and knowing that the first six months of 2016 were fraught with illness, I’m super-proud that I managed to cross off so many of the goals I set myself.;;;;;;;;;
Every year, I look back and evaluate how well I did with each of my goals and decide whether that’s as far as I want to pursue it or whether I want to further it in the following year.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how I did in 2016!;;;;;;;;;
My favourite island in the South Pacific: Huahine!;;;;;;;;;
To Shatter More Myths About Expensive Destinations;;;;;;;;;
Much like I did with the Maldives, I’ll be spending January showing you how cheaply you can visit paradise. I’ll be travelling to the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and Fiji, writing detailed guides to how you can visit them for under $50 a day.;;;;;;;;;

Yep! I passed this challenge with flying colours. I spent just under a month in the South Pacific and saw so much beauty that I’m still processing it today. My posts about how to visit the Cook Islands and Bora Bora on a budget were some of my most successful last year, which gives me the motivation to hit up even more paradise islands on the cheap in 2017. Hi, Mauritius!;;;;;;;;;
I finally made it to Venice!;;;;;;;;;
To Visit My Big European Oversights;;;;;;;;;
It’s 90% likely Dave and I will end up making our base in Europe, which will give me the perfect opportunity to visit the places I really should have seen by now. I’ve explored a significant chunk of the continent, but there are several key destinations I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve never seen.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Paris.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Berlin.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Greece.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Check! Check! And check! I spent a full summer visiting all of my European oversights. I sailed around the Ionian in Greece, then finally made it to Venice, Berlin, and Paris!;;;;;;;;;
My summer in Europe was one of the best trips I’ve taken in recent years and I enjoyed every second. Well, apart from all of that Airbnb drama. I can see me doing exactly the same this year and spending another couple of months bouncing around the continent I now call home.;;;;;;;;;
To Take One Trip I’ve Never Considered Before;;;;;;;;;
I want to get out of my comfort zone this year and try something I would normally steer away from. It could be anything from a yoga retreat to a surf instructor course; a spa holiday in a 5* resort to a camping trip. I think it’ll be fun to try something that’s not me at all and see how much I enjoy/hate it.;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
I smashed this one out of the park, too! While I’m not adverse to splurging on a little bit of luxury when I travel, I recently discovered I only ever do it for a special occasion, which usually means Dave’s birthday. When I travel solo? I stick exclusively to dorm rooms in hostels and opt to save as much money as possible. Why the hell do I never view myself worthy of treating? In 2016, I made up for this and spent a shit ton of money on a stay in one of the best hotels in Berlin. Not only that, but I had my first massage since Bangkokgate and proved how far I’ve come by eating solo at a two-Michelin-star restaurant.;;;;;;;;;
I obviously loved the experience, because who wouldn’t? Would I do it again? Um. I mean, maybe if I was in a cheaper part of the world? At roughly $2000 for a five night stay, I just didn’t feel like the value was there to justify doing it again to that extent. This trip was all about treating myself, though, and proving that I was worth the occasional splurge, so I didn’t dwell on the insane cost, but yeah. So much money!;;;;;;;;;
Nice from above;;;;;;;;;
To Visit a Country That Intimidates Other People;;;;;;;;;
I love shattering perceptions when I travel, so I’m hoping 2016 will be the year I visit somewhere other people view as dangerous to see what it can offer tourists. At present, Pakistan is at the top of the list – a friend of mine lives there, and I’ve received many offers from my Pakistani readers to show me around. 2016 may just be the year I finally take them up on it. Failing that, Iran remains permanently on my list of dream destinations, as does overlanding across West Africa.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This is a tough one to evaluate, because how do you know if a place intimidates other people?;;;;;;;;;
The only destination I think could count would be France, and that’s mainly because Nice intimidated the fuck out of me. The police presence was overwhelming, the locals were jumping at the slightest sound, and news reports were all about recently foiled attacks. I’m ashamed to admit I gave into fear and spent most of my time there terrified about leaving my room.;;;;;;;;;
I have some American friends who have sworn off visiting France in their lifetime [?!] after the terrorist attacks, but is it really all that intimidating? Is it as intimidating to people as Pakistan, Iran, or West Africa?;;;;;;;;;

I think this is probably a fail, but I’ll count it as a maybe for now. Let me know what you think in the comments! :-) I’ll most likely roll this over into my 2017 goals regardless and give it a better attempt this year.;;;;;;;;;
Because when have me and danger not gone well together?;;;;;;;;;

To Start Taking More Defined Trips;;;;;;;;;
[I want to] spend several months writing and scheduling posts on Never Ending Footsteps so I can then spend a month offline and fully immersing myself in a destination. I’ll be able to research a place instead of just turning up and winging it; I’ll be able to take tours and do activities because I won’t be writing; I’ll be able to get to know a place more than superficially because I’ll be outside exploring. All of this means more detailed coverage of destinations on the site and a healthier, happier version of me.;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Did I achieve it? Yep! The vast majority of my travels in 2016 were well-defined, which was so easy to do now that I have a base. A trip to Girona to see friends, a trip to Evora to eat and drink, a trip to check out my European oversights, then time in Lisbon to decompress and process those destinations.;;;;;;;;;
Having a base to return to meant that I greatly improved the way I travelled. I managed to do a lot of research (I own guidebooks now!), took multiple tours, explored the places I visited in greater depth, and felt that I could offer more detailed coverage here because of it. The only part of this goal I didn’t achieve was spending my trips offline, but let’s be real: was I really going to achieve that? (No.);;;;;;;;;
Finally getting back to my pre-travel weight in Greece!;;;;;;;;;
To Be Able to Do 100 Push Ups;;;;;;;;;
Last year, I discovered my love of push-ups and have worked my way up to the point where I can do twenty proper ones without stopping. I’m giving myself a year to get to a hundred.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Guys, I got so close! I got up to eighty fucking six without stopping and then I got an infection (the real theme of 2016!) and had to take a break. By the time I got back to it, I had slid way down to only being able to do 20. I couldn’t work my way back up in time for the end of the year, but I’m totally going to carry this over into 2017, because push ups rock.;;;;;;;;;
To Be Able to Do the Splits;;;;;;;;;
Real-life friends will laugh at this, as being able to do the splits has been a mainstay in my resolutions list for more than a decade. I’ve always dreamed of it, but never been able to commit to enough stretching to make it happen. I got close in Mexico two years ago, but then I got glandular fever/mono, and it all slipped away from me. 2016 is the year.;;;;;;;;;
Nope! But it wouldn’t be a Lauren resolution list if it didn’t have me failing to do the splits somewhere in it. I was fairly dedicated to my goal this year and spent 15 minutes every evening stretching out my muscles, but I would stop every time I took a trip, then return to Lisbon to find myself back at square one again. Will 2017 be the year I finally get to do them? Probably not, but you know I’ll give it a shot anyway.;;;;;;;;;
To run a 10k;;;;;;;;;
I got into running last year, surprised to discover how frequent exercise puts me in a positive frame of mind. I half-ran, half-jogged a 5k race in 2015 and with a full twelve months to get in shape, I’m confident I can reach the point where I can run a 10k without stopping.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
This was tough. I tried so hard to achieve this, but ended up realising that running is just not something I enjoy, or something that comes easily to me.;;;;;;;;;
This year, I managed to run my furthest distance ever — 5 kilometres without stopping, ha — and it almost killed me. I had chest pains for days afterwards and it would hurt to breathe, my feet had this weird tingling nerve pain for at least a week after, and on my walk home from the gym (yes, I did this on a treadmill), I had to drop to the ground to put my head between my knees because I was so close to fainting. So that put me off attempting to push myself to run even further.;;;;;;;;;
As much as I want to be runner, I don’t think it’s going to work for me. But that’s okay, because I discovered strength training this year and love it.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t have any photos to use for my fitness goals, so here’s a really big rock in Bora Bora.;;;;;;;;;
Take Rock Climbing Lessons;;;;;;;;;
I was answering interview questions a few weeks ago and the first one had to do with my hobbies. I froze. My hobbies? I realised I don’t actually have any. I travel, I plan my travels, I read about travel, and I write about travel. And travel kind of makes it hard to cultivate other passions.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Rock climbing is something I’ve always wanted to try. With a base and a routine, I’m going to give it a go.;;;;;;;;;
Fail. I actually signed up for a rock climbing class while I was in Seattle, but found myself with a bladder and sinus infection on the day of the class, so had to cancel. Fail, fail, fail, but I did make a decent attempt at it.;;;;;;;;;
Find a Gym and Start Weightlifting;;;;;;;;;
As soon as Dave and I find our base, I’m joining a gym and getting a personal trainer. It’s time to get strong.;;;;;;;;;
In 2017, I joined a gym, created a strength training workout with a personal trainer, and made a conscious effort to stop writing at 3 p.m. in order to work out.;;;;;;;;;
I freaking love strength training and I love what it does to my body. Did you know that it also burns way more calories than cardio? I didn’t. I love that I can go to the gym, lift weights for twenty minutes, and walk out knowing I’ve had a far more effective workout than running until I get chest pains.;;;;;;;;;
I went alcohol-free for the Whole30!;;;;;;;;;
Experiment With the Whole30 Diet;;;;;;;;;
Diets are often a bad idea, especially ones like the Whole30, which are incredibly restrictive. But at the same time, I believe it could be beneficial for my anxiety. I know that your diet can drastically affect your mental health, and when I cut out sugar for a couple of weeks a few years back, I felt incredible.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve wanted to try something drastic for years, but travel — and rarely having a kitchen — has made it near-impossible. I’m excited to see if it has any major benefits for my anxiety.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Check! Doing the Whole30 was probably the best thing I did in 2016. It switched my panic attacks from daily to naught, helped me lose 10 lbs and get me back to my pre-travel weight, took away my motion sickness and allergies, ended the migraines and cramps I used to have on my period, and stopped me from needing afternoon naps. It gave me consistent energy levels, motivation, and random bursts of euphoria. Who knew that inflammation-causing foods had been wreaking so much havoc on my life?;;;;;;;;;
These days, I aim to eat paleo 80% of the time, keeping as much dairy, gluten, and sugar out of my diet as possible.;;;;;;;;;
Meditate Five Times a Week;;;;;;;;;
I know that if I set myself a goal of meditating every day, I’ll never stick to it, but five days a week is an achievable goal. Again, it’s all about getting to grips with my anxiety and feeling stronger and healthier. I know meditation will help me; it’s just about remembering to do it on the days when I feel fantastic rather than solely on the day after I have a panic attack.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Check! 2016 was the year of Headspace, and I found so many benefits to meditation that I kept it up even when my anxiety melted away. Meditating calms me down, gives me focus, improves my productivity, and makes me happy. I fully plan on continuing with this into 2017 and am even looking up silent vipassana retreats for later on in the year!;;;;;;;;;
To Give Myself at Least One Month Offline;;;;;;;;;
When I hit the reset button earlier this year, one of the best things I did for myself was to stop. No writing, no social media, no emails. This year, I’m going to try and take a minimum of one month offline to do anything that doesn’t involve writing. My month in Greece could be the perfect time to do it.;;;;;;;;;
Yes! I achieved this in the South Pacific, where I was completely offline aside from chatting to Dave and uploading the occasional photo to Facebook. I also spent two additional months entirely offline this year, but it was because I had health problems to deal with, not because I was spending time reading and working out and doing other fun stuff. So technically, yes, I more than rocked this goal, but it just wasn’t quite how I envisioned it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To Learn How to Cook;;;;;;;;;
I used to find it was funny that the only dish I could make was a sandwich, but now it feels like a huge embarrassment and failure as a human. I can make toast and I can put things into an oven, and sometimes I can even chop vegetables without slicing my hand open, but that’s it.;;;;;;;;;
Travel has opened my eyes to the joy of food – it’s now one of my favourite ways to learn more about the world – and I’m gutted to have such limited cooking abilities. With a long-term home on the agenda, one of the first things I’m going to do is pick up a handful of recipe books and start recreating my favourite dishes from around the world.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Check! I hugely improved my cooking skills this year and tried out hundreds of new dishes. It’s reached the point where I almost feel disappointed when I go out to a restaurant to eat.;;;;;;;;;
The Whole30 was huge for this, because not being able to eat out for 90 meals straight meant that I was in the kitchen all month long. Now, I make curries at least once a week. I make my own hummus, pesto, and garlic mayonnaise. I make the best roast potatoes in the world. I’m all about paleo pancakes that are gluten and dairy-free. I love herbs and spices and creating my own recipes from scratch.;;;;;;;;;
I totally rocked this goal in 2016.;;;;;;;;;

To Gain Confidence With my Spanish;;;;;;;;;
I’d always been confident in my Spanish language skills until I spent time in Mexico and Spain. Suddenly, people were laughing at how I spoke Spanish with a British accent and asking why I don’t use a Spanish accent. And it knocked my confidence so hard to the point that I barely utter a word when I’m in Spanish-speaking countries; I’m too embarrassed to speak. These days, I stand awkwardly and understand everything that’s going on, but keep my lips firmly sealed.;;;;;;;;
Last year, I worked hard on not caring about what people think of me, and this is one of my few remaining hangups I can work on. I’ll be spending a month in Oaxaca at the start of the year, then potentially moving to Spain a few months later, so there’s no excuse.;;;;;;;;;
Check! I totally achieved this while I was in Oaxaca. I nailed it in my original description: it’s all about getting over yourself and stopping caring what other people think. Once I vaulted that barrier, I was more than happy to mangle a foreign language in front of anyone.;;;;;;;;;
If I had achieved this goal, I would buy a yacht. And yes, I have run out of relevant photos to use in this post.;;;;;;;;;
Write Another Book;;;;;;;;;
I swore I would never write another book after the first one destroyed my mental health, but this one will be different. I’m keeping it under wraps for now, but I can tell you that it’s about travel, I’ll be self-publishing, and it’s not a memoir. I hope to release it within the first six months of 2016.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
That’s a nope again! I was hoping to release a book about how to overcome your fears and anxiety in order to travel, but I managed to write so much about it that I’ve decided to turn it into a course. I’m currently hard at work on it and hope to have it launched by April. More details about that coming soon!;;;;;;;;;
But yeah, no book from me in 2016. Maybe this year!;;;;;;;;;
Create Detailed Resources on Never Ending Footsteps;;;;;;;;;
This year, I want to work on sharing the expertise I’ve gathered from five years of living the nomadic dream. Like how to travel when you have anxiety. Or a detailed guide to what to pack and what to leave behind. Or how to travel long-term. Or how to work from anywhere. I’m talking 10,000+ word resources that contain everything I know about a topic. 2016 is the year where I start producing helpful content as well as narratives about my disasters.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That’s a sort-of-but-mostly-no for this one.;;;;;;;;;
I actually did write way more helpful resources this year than any other year to date, and shared why I only use Osprey backpacks, how much it costs to travel for a year, as well as travel expense posts for Taiwan and Belize, my 100 best travel tips, a packing list for Greece, how I find cheap flights, how to overcome a fear of flying, and how to back up your photos as you travel.;;;;;;;;;
But very few of them were in-depth guides. When I set myself this goal, I was thinking of producing enormous articles similar to my guide on how to start a travel blog, which contains many thousands of words on everything I know about that topic. Beyond my 100 best travel tips post, which was came in at almost 7,000 words, I failed on this front.;;;;;;;;;
Get My Work in Big Publications;;;;;;;;;
I’ve created a list of ten magazines, newspapers, and websites that being featured in would blow my mind, and another list of ten major publications I’m confident I can write for. I suck at marketing myself and actively avoid putting my words in front of another site’s audience, so 2016 will be all about growing my confidence by getting featured in new places.;;;;;;;;;
Fail! My anxiety had me struggling to write posts for this site let alone anyone else’s. I actually did get my site mentioned in twenty-odd news sites around the world when a post of mine went viral, but I’m not going to include that, because I didn’t actively do anything to make it happen. I did manage to squeeze out a guest post on Problogger about how I gained a book deal through my travel blog, but that was it for 2016. I’ll do better this year.;;;;;;;;;

To Switch Up My Social Media Focus;;;;;;;;;
My Instagram account has been sorely neglected from the day I created it, but I’m proud of my engagement levels there. My photos gain between 150 and 250 likes from an audience of 3,000 followers, but 3,000 isn’t great. By the end of the year, I’m hoping to have 20,000. I’m excited to start sharing a mix of my favourite travel photos and what I’m currently up to!;;;;;;;;;
So close! I actually managed to grow my Instagram account from 3,000 followers to 17,000 this year while still maintaining high levels of engagement.;;;;;;;;;
Pinterest is another site I’ve been neglecting, but I’ve become obsessed with it over the past few months. I’m also terrible at it. I think almost all of my blogging buddies cite Pinterest as their highest referrer. Me? I get 100 visits a month. By the end of 2016, I’m hoping for 50,000 monthly referrals. Aim high!;;;;;;;;;
This was definitely aiming high for me! While I experienced a huge amount of growth with Pinterest this year (growing from 100 visits a month to 3,500), this was nowhere near my original goal. One day I’ll crack it and score the huge amounts of traffic that other bloggers get from it.;;;;;;;;;
Youtube is another area I’m going to focus on. After my packing video went somewhat viral, I find my channel with 150,000 views, 1,100 subscribers, and people emailing me every few weeks to tell me they found my video, was inspired to quit their job, and have been travelling ever since! All that from one video and a site I haven’t signed into for a year. This year, I want to start producing high quality Q&A videos. To put some numbers on it, I hope to get a minimum of 25 videos uploaded and grow my audience to 5,000 subscribers.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. I didn’t have the mental strength to record videos this year, so didn’t even attempt it. I most likely won’t in 2017 either, but you never know. I don’t actually want to have my eggs in every goddamn social basket on the planet anymore. I grew my account from 1,100 to 1,370 subscribers this year, but it was all organic.;;;;;;;;;
So, how did I do?;;;;;;;;;
Pretty damn well, considering much of the first half of the year ended up being a write-off.;;;;;;;;;
I killed it with my travel and health goals, did okay with my fitness ones, and failed hard at my work ones — that shows me which areas I need to focus on more in 2017. I achieved 11 out of 20 goals in total, with a couple of maybes thrown in there.;;;;;;;;;
Up next: what I’m hoping to achieve in 2017!;;;;;;;;;

From the moment this site took its first trembling breath, it’s been all about travelling full-time. I mean, just look at the name! I started Never Ending Footsteps with the enormously unrealistic dream of travelling the world forever. And somehow, less than a year after my first post went live, I’d managed to build a business that would allowed me to do just that. I couldn’t believe my luck.;;;;;;;;;
I was living the dream.;;;;;;;;;
Being paid to travel the world? Having the freedom to spend a month on the beach and not having to work if I didn’t want to? Getting to fly to Morocco on a whim because the flights were cheap and I’d always wanted to go? Spending my Monday mornings on Bora Bora while friends trudged to work in the rain?;;;;;;;;;
How many people would kill to have a life like that?;;;;;;;;;
Me. Five years ago, I would have killed to have a life like that.;;;;;;;;;
In the Cook Islands;;;;;;;;;
So, what happened?;;;;;;;;;
Over the past couple of years, I’ve come to the realisation that full-time travel isn’t sustainable for me. It wasn’t healthy. It was exhausting. My mental and physical health hit rock bottom. Travel stopped being enjoyable. I lost my sense of community. My sense of wonder. Lost touch with my friends. Lost touch with the *real world*. Lost sight of myself. I became a one-dimensional human who thought about travel, spoke with travellers about travel, planned my upcoming travels, and then travelled. Oh, and I wrote about travel, too.;;;;;;;;;
Travel? I wholeheartedly believe it’s one of the best things you can do in life. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done. Travelling year after year after year after year? The benefits didn’t stick around for me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It took a long time for me to admit this to myself and even longer to write about it publicly.;;;;;;;;;
It was roughly two years ago that travel stopped being as fun, and that mere realisation made me feel terrible.;;;;;;;;;
I had this dream life. I had a life that millions of people would dream of having. I could wake up and jump on a plane to South Africa if I felt like it, then fly to Brazil the week after that. I was even making enough passive income to be able to take a year off work if I felt like it. So why was I so fucking miserable? Why I was I having panic attacks every night for months on end? Why had I contracted eight separate infections in 12 months? Why was I permanently unwell? Why couldn’t I see how lucky I was? There had to be something wrong with me, because who has a life like that and isn’t happy?;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t just these feelings of shame that forced me to continue moving. It was the fact that my entire identity had been built around travel.;;;;;;;;;
I liked that I could tell people I’d been travelling for five years, and that they’d find it impressive or interesting. I liked doing something unconventional. I liked writing about being a full-time traveller. I liked differentiating myself from all of the other bloggers who had dropped off to find a base. Because they, too, had found full-time travel to be unsustainable.;;;;;;;;;
Who would I be if I stopped travelling constantly? Would I be boring? I didn’t have any hobbies. I didn’t know what my passions were outside of travel. What would be the interesting thing I told people about myself? I know it sounds like I was caring way too much about what other people think of me, but I kind of run my business around me living an unconventional life of full-time travel. How I would I brand myself on my site if I stopped? Would my readers all unsubscribe?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, I travelled and I travelled and I travelled some more.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

I tried slowing down last year, basing myself in Granada for four months, then Madrid for six weeks, then the UK for a month, then Taipei for a month, then Melbourne for a month.;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t help.;;;;;;;;;
It turned out it wasn’t the pace of my travels that were the problem; it was the lack of constants in my life. The lack of stability. Those aspects of travel that I used to thrive off of started to make me sick.;;;;;;;;
When I discovered the only thing that would stop my panic attacks in their tracks was talking about stopping travelling and finding a home, I knew what I had to do.;;;;;;;;;
I needed to make a change.;;;;;;;;;
So that’s exactly what I did.;;;;;;;;;
It was two years later than I should have done it, but I’ve done it now, and I’ve never felt happier, healthier, or stronger.;;;;;;;;;
I. am. so. so. so. happy.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s why it was finally time for me to stop.;;;;;;;;;
Macbook rage;;;;;;;;;
I Struggled to Run My Business While Travelling;;;;;;;;;
Let me tell you about one of my recent travel days.;;;;;;;;;
I was in Paris for the very first time and I wanted to see everything. On my first morning, I walked from my Airbnb apartment to the Notre Dame to the Eiffel Tower to the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre, getting my tourist on and racking up 25,000 steps on my Fitbit in the process.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I got home at 8 p.m., absolutely shattered. I sat down on the sofa, opened my laptop, and started writing a blog post about a cocktail tour I took in New Orleans six months ago. My mind was somewhere else, though. My mind was in Paris and processing everything I’d experienced that day. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t put myself in a New Orleans frame of mind and I struggled to remember how it felt to be there. I managed to write around 200 words before I passed out on the couch from exhaustion.;;;;;;;;;
That’s been my life for the past five years. I’ve been in a constant state of over-stimulation.;;;;;;;;;
It’s hard enough to regularly publish blog posts about places you’re not currently in, but what about if you want to further your business even more? I’m currently in the process of putting together two travel-related books and a course on how to score a publishing deal. I have a list of so. many. things. I want to do to improve this site, but I can’t even start on any of them when I’m constantly moving.;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’m not travelling full-time: I have the time and energy to write about my travels without also having to deal with stimulation overload. I can work on side projects without having to skip out on seeing a major tourist attraction in a city. I can prepare for upcoming trips by writing posts in advance and scheduling them for my time away. Work is so much less stressful when I’m staying in one place.;;;;;;;;;
As an added bonus, since stopping, I’ve managed to publish posts more frequently than when I was permanently on the road and tripled my income!;;;;;;;;;
Me at ten kilograms heavier than I was when I left to travel. Yes, all of my weight goes to my butt, lol.;;;;;;;;;
Travel Made Me So Unhealthy;;;;;;;;;
I put on 20lbs/10kgs while I was travelling, and that’s a lot for someone who’s only 5’1”.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I lost it all within a few months of finding a base, getting a gym membership, and eating better.;;;;;;;;;
When I joined a gym and saw my personal trainer for the first time, my BMI had me pegged as being overweight. That has never happened before — I’ve always been slightly underweight if anything!;;;;;;;;;
It’s not even that Dave and I eat unhealthily when we travel. It’s that we would eat out for every. single. meal. Eating at restaurants three times a day sounds amazing, and we certainly ate well, but it’s not exactly the healthiest option. Sure, we could get an Airbnb apartment and cook for ourselves, but buying spices and ingredients and stuff ends up being ridiculous when we have to abandon them all three days later when we leave the country. Plus, one of our favourite aspects of travel is getting to try the local food. Could you imagine if I visited Paris and spent the entire trip eating boiled vegetables in my apartment?;;;;;;;;;
As well as having a poor diet, it’s tough to exercise when you’re always on the move. You can’t have a gym membership, doing bodyweight workouts in a dorm rooms is weird, and running is tough when the pavement makes way for open sewers and it’s 90% humidity from sunrise to sunset.;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’m not travelling full-time: I have a gym membership, I do pilates, I go for runs outside, I cook for myself, and eat much healthier. I’m no longer overweight and I feel stronger and healthier, too.;;;;;;;;;
Most importantly: I got to do the Whole30 and use my results from that to learn that I’m intolerant to histamine and start building a low histamine diet that has drastically improved my anxiety. I could not have done that while travelling. As someone with a fragile brain, getting to take better care of myself has hugely improved my quality of life.;;;;;;;;;

Before I stopped travelling full-time, I was having such severe panic attacks that I often couldn’t even find the strength to step outside my apartment. Since stopping and changing up my diet, I haven’t had a single panic attack in over a year.;;;;;;;;;
Me with all of my friends, lol.;;;;;;;;;
I Kind of Lost My Community of Friends;;;;;;;;;
My best friends back home have new best friends now.;;;;;;;;;
It’s to be expected. I’ve disappeared out of their lives for over five years. I tried to keep in touch and send Facebook messages regularly, and we Skyped and chatted plenty. But it all stopped eventually. Soon, our online catch ups turned to them talking about work and me talking about travel and neither of us really connecting with each other anymore. We ran out of things to talk about in minutes rather than hours.;;;;;;;;;
I understand, but it makes me sad.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And sure, you can say that real friends never abandon you, but put yourself in their position: if one of your friends disappeared around the world for six straight years, and still showed no sign of ever returning, wouldn’t you move on and form closer friendships with the people who still were in your life?;;;;;;;;;
You make so many friends when you travel, and it’s surprisingly easy to do so, even when you’re a socially awkward person like me. And then you say goodbye three days later and you never see them again. And onto the next friendship and the next and the next. I’ve missed going for beers with someone I’ve known for years and sharing inside jokes and having mutual friends and doing that once a week rather than once and never again.;;;;;;;;;
And although I feel like I can chat with any traveller for days, travel kind of killed my social skills with anyone else. When all you’ve done is one thing for five years, it’s hard to relate to someone working the 9-5. I don’t know how to small talk with people who have never travelled. I don’t know how to bitch about corporate jobs and terrible bosses. I don’t know how to talk about kids and babies and schools and shopping and gossip about celebrities. It’s embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’ve stopped travelling: I can actually form a community of friends that I get to see multiple times a week rather than once a year — and I have! Within months of Dave and I settling down, we’d found a community of several dozen digital nomads who are based in Lisbon long-term. I love that I can put up a message in a Facebook group at any time looking for someone to go for drinks with and be almost guaranteed to be sat in a bar with someone within an hour. And that they’re not a stranger — we don’t have to have the same old conversation about where we’ve been and where we’re going! My life feels so much richer for it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Needed a Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;
Let’s talk mental health, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s funny, because I’ve kind of become known as the travel blogger with anxiety in recent times. I’ve been so broken.;;;;;;;;;
It’s weird to me, because for the first three years of my travels, I wasn’t even in the slightest bit anxious. I had maybe five panic attacks. And sure, things freaked me out and I was full of irrational thought processes, but real anxiety? Anxiety that prevented me from going outside? From eating? That only happened post-book.;;;;;;;;;
And travel made it so much worse.;;;;;;;;;
I mentioned above that talking about finding a base was the only thing to halt my panic attacks, and it’s true. I’d be sat down in a restaurant, hyperventilating while having all the symptoms of a heart attack, and all Dave would have to say would be, tell me about your sanctuary.;;;;;;;;;
I’d focus then on having a home and turning one of the rooms into a place for me. It would be white and cosy, with soft lighting and bean bags and cushions. It would be a place with candles and colouring books and a meditation space and essential oils. And whenever I felt anxious, I could go to that physical place and I would feel better again.;;;;;;;;;
That’s all I had to think about to stop my panic attacks.;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’ve stopped travelling full-time: I have the exact sanctuary I couldn’t stop thinking about and it’s one of the few things in my life that never fails to calm my mind. I don’t even spend that much time in there, but knowing it’s an option and that it’s there for me was all I needed.;;;;;;;;;
Having a panic attack and having to spend my day in a dorm room surrounded by people I didn’t know was awful — sometimes just the fear of that was enough to make me anxious. Having a home makes me so much stronger.;;;;;;;;;
My mental health has to come first — yes, above even travel — and if ending my continuous trip is what improves it, I have to listen to my brain.;;;;;;;;;

I Lost My Sense of Wonder;;;;;;;;;
I used to pride myself on my childlike sense of wonder. Every time I visited a waterfall, I’d stop and pretend it was the first one I’d ever seen. I would do everything I could to prevent myself from comparing it to the other, more impressive waterfalls I’d seen on my travels.;;;;;;;;;
After five years of seeing waterfall after waterfall after waterfall, though? Eventually it just became falling water and I can see that whenever I take a shower.;;;;;;;;;
Mountains became giant rocks in my eyes. Deserts became huge stretches of tiny stones. Glaciers became massive ice cubes.;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, I became jaded.;;;;;;;;;
And I didn’t want it to happen! It’s disappointing, frustrating, upsetting, but I can’t change how I feel.;;;;;;;;;
When you spend every single day of your life chasing something new and exciting, eventually you kind of run out of new and exciting things to see. Your tolerance builds. Suddenly, it takes something something mind-blowingly incredible to impress you.;;;;;;;;;
I think my priorities changed, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back before I travelled, that was my number one priority; it was all I was focused on. I even remember when I thought I was going to die in the tsunami, my first thought was, oh god no, I’m not going to get to Antarctica. Yeah, seriously.;;;;;;;;
At some point, probably right around the time I started feeling jaded, my family became a much bigger priority in my life. I prioritise spending time with the people I love over travel now. I don’t want to wake up in twenty years’ time and have my parents be dead and wish I’d spent more time with them rather than skipping through countries for years on end.;;;;;;;;;
Now that I’m not travelling full-time: The grass is always greener, so now that I have a base, I can take a break from chasing waterfalls. But that also means that eventually I start craving travel again, and I begin to appreciate the falling water and those giant ice cubes when I’m not spending every day seeking them out. My life feels more balanced.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I thought I was living the dream because I was “travelling forever”.;;;;;;;;;
But the truth is: I was living the dream because I had the freedom to travel forever if I wanted to.;;;;;;;;;
And because I also have the freedom to stop.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I like knowing that full-time travel will always be an option for as long as I continue to work online. That makes the decision to stop far less scarier.;;;;;;;;;
My Life Now;;;;;;;;;
It’s been six months since I stopped travelling full-time and decided to base myself in Portugal. I’ve never been happier.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve realised I’m the type of human who needs stability and constants and guarantees. Even if it’s just the guarantee that I can leave my routine whenever I feel like it.;;;;;;;;;
My life is just so much richer now, even though it’s kind of boring some days. It’s balanced. I have a gym membership and a constant set of friends and a home I can fill with the things I want to buy. I no longer have to throw something out if I ever want to buy something new! I’m picking up hobbies now, and learning who I am as a person outside of travel. I’m learning how to cook for the first time. I’m working on my mental health and taking great steps towards finding my anxious-free self again. I’ve got a dozen favourite restaurants in my neighbourhood, now, and a local park to sunbathe in. I spend half of the year in a beautiful city that’s close to the beach and feels like home whenever I return.;;;;;;;;;
And when it comes to travel itself? I’m still doing so much of it.;;;;;;;;;
In 2017, I based myself in Lisbon for six months and travelled for six months. I visited 15 countries. I saw and did just as much as I did when I was travelling full-time, but instead of travelling for a month and then finding an Airbnb apartment for a month to recover, I was able to return to the same apartment and live a normal life for a while before jetting off again.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hopefully this post doesn’t come off as me whinging or sounding negative — I want it to be a positive post, because I’ve finally made the change I’ve been craving for years, and it worked out exactly as I’d hoped. I haven’t even had so much as a cold since finding a home (I had eight infections in the year before I arrived in Lisbon!), my business is doing better than ever, and I no longer suffer from debilitating panic attacks.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I hope I don’t disappoint anyone by ending my full-time travels, either. I’ll still be travelling just as much as before, but rather than spending month-long stints in different cities to recover between trips, I’ll be heading to Lisbon instead.;;;;;;;;;
This is something I had to do.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve learned that I need stability and routine in my life in order to stay strong, healthy, and happy.;;;;;;;;;
And you know me — I love to share both the good and bad sides of everything. I think there is a dark side to full-time travel, and it’s one I’m glad to have finally acknowledged.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
TL;DR: I work, travel, and live better when I don’t try to do all three at the same time. ;;;;;;;;

Change.";;;;;;;;;
Change and experimentation.;;;;;;;;;
And stopping.;;;;;;;;;
This is the year Dave and I finally find a base to return to between trips – we’ve been wanting to take the plunge for a couple of years, but ended up giving in to our wanderlust at the expense of our sanity, health, and travel. Finding a base means we’ll be able to travel better and work better, which means higher quality and more frequent posts for you.;;;;;;;;;
I feel as though I’ve been treading water for several years and I’m finally on the brink of drowning. January will be about solo adventuring in the South Pacific, February will revolve around eating with friends in Mexico, March will be full of puppy love when we housesit in Seattle for friends, and then Dave and I will be searching for a home. A real home. A place we can fill with furniture and love. I’m already planning on creating a soundproof sanctuary I can hide away in whenever I’m overwhelmed.;;;;;;;;;
So, change. Setting defined and achievable goals is important to me, and I regularly set myself specific targets to work towards, rather than vague ideas to lose weight or eat healthier. This year, I’ve decided to publicly share them in order to hold myself accountable and keep you updated on my progress throughout the year. I’m confident I can hit them all.;;;;;;;;;
Here goes!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel Goals;;;;;;;;;
To Visit a Country That Intimidates Other People;;;;;;;;;
I love shattering perceptions when I travel, so I’m hoping that 2016 will be the year I visit somewhere other people view as dangerous to see what it can offer tourists. At present, Pakistan is at the top of the list – a good friend of mine lives there, and I’ve received many offers from my Pakistani readers to show me around. 2016 may just be the year I finally take them up on it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Failing that, Iran remains permanently on my list of dream destinations, as does overlanding across West Africa.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To Visit My Big European Oversights;;;;;;;;;
It’s 90% likely Dave and I will end up making our base in Europe, which will give me the perfect opportunity to visit the places I really should have seen by now. I’ve explored a significant chunk of the continent, but there are several key destinations I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve never seen.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Paris.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Berlin.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never been to Greece.;;;;;;;;;
One thing’s for certain: September is going to be all about Greece. Every couple of years, Dave and his best friend gather a group of people and charter a yacht somewhere in the world for a fortnight of sunshine, swimming, and beers. This year, we’ll be sailing the lesser-visited Ionian coast in Greece, then Dave and I will be hitting up the tourist spots afterwards. I can’t wait to eat everything!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Much like I did with the Maldives, I’ll be spending January showing you how cheaply you can visit paradise. I’ll be travelling to the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, and Fiji, writing detailed guides to how you can visit them for under $50 a day. Yes, you can even do that in Bora Bora!;;;;;;;;;
I’m keeping my plans loose for the rest of the year, but if I can find the time, I’d also love to head to the Seychelles and Mauritius to make up for having to cancel my trip last year.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To Start Taking More Defined Trips;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I mentioned in the introduction that having a base will better my travels, and it’s because I can start taking more defined trips rather than floating from place to place, spending the majority of my time on my laptop.;;;;;;;;;
How will it work? I’ll spend several months writing and scheduling posts on Never Ending Footsteps so that I can then spend a month offline and fully immersing myself in a destination. I’ll be able to research a place instead of just turning up and winging it; I’ll be able to take tours and do activities because I won’t be writing; I’ll be able to get to know a place more than superficially because I’ll be outside exploring. All of this means more detailed coverage of destinations on the site and a healthier, happier version of me.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To Take One Trip I’ve Never Considered Before;;;;;;;;;
I want to get out of my comfort zone this year and try something I would normally steer away from. It could be anything from a yoga retreat to a surf instructor course; a spa holiday in a 5* resort to a camping trip. I think it’ll be fun to try something that’s not me at all and see how much I enjoy/hate it.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Fitness Goals;;;;;;;;;
To be able to do 100 push ups;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Last year, I discovered my love of push-ups and have worked my way up to the point where I can do twenty proper ones without stopping. I’m giving myself a year to get to a hundred.;;;;;;;;;
To be able to do the splits;;;;;;;;;
Real-life friends will laugh at this, as being able to do the splits has been a mainstay in my resolutions list for more than a decade. I’ve always dreamed of it, but never been able to commit to enough stretching to make it happen. I got close in Mexico two years ago, but then I caught glandular fever/mono, and it all slipped away from me. 2016 is the year.;;;;;;;;;
To run a 10k ;;;;;;;;;
I got into running last year, surprised to discover how frequent exercise puts me in a positive frame of mind. I half-ran, half-jogged a 5k race in 2015 and with a full twelve months to get in shape, I’m confident I can reach the point where I can run a 10k without stopping.;;;;;;;;;
Take Rock Climbing Lessons;;;;;;;;;
I was answering interview questions a few weeks ago and the first one had to do with my hobbies. I froze. My hobbies? I realised I don’t actually have any. I travel, I plan my travels, I read about travel, and I write about travel. And travel kind of makes it hard to cultivate other passions.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Rock climbing is something I’ve always wanted to try. With a base and a routine, I’m going to give it a go.;;;;;;;;;
Find a Gym and Start Weightlifting;;;;;;;;;
As soon as Dave and I find our base, I’m joining a gym and getting a personal trainer. It’s time to get strong.;;;;;;;;;
Health and Lifestyle Goals;;;;;;;;;
Experiment With the Whole30 Diet;;;;;;;;;
Diets are often a bad idea, especially ones like the Whole30, which are incredibly restrictive. But at the same time, I believe it could be beneficial for my anxiety. I know that your diet can drastically affect your mental health, and when I cut out sugar for a couple of weeks a few years back, I felt incredible.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve wanted to try something drastic for years, but travel — and rarely having a kitchen — has made it near-impossible. I’m excited to see if it has any major benefits for my anxiety.;;;;;;;;;
Meditate Five Times a Week;;;;;;;;;
I know that if I set myself a goal of meditating every day, I’ll never stick to it, but five days a week is an achievable goal. Again, it’s all about getting to grips with my anxiety and feeling stronger and healthier. I know meditation will help me; it’s just about remembering to do it on the days when I feel fantastic rather than solely on the day after I have a panic attack.;;;;;;;;
To Give Myself at Least One Month Offline;;;;;;;;;
When I hit the reset button earlier this year, one of the best things I did for myself was to stop. No writing, no social media, no emails.;;;;;;;;;
This year, I’m going to try and take a minimum of one month offline to do anything that doesn’t involve writing. My month in Greece could be the perfect time to do it.;;;;;;;;;
To Learn How to Cook;;;;;;;;;
I used to find it was funny that the only dish I could make was a sandwich, but now it feels like a huge embarrassment and failure as a human. I can make toast and I can put things into an oven, and sometimes I can even chop vegetables without slicing my hand open, but that’s it.;;;;;;;;;
Travel has opened my eyes to the joy of food – it’s now one of my favourite ways to learn more about the world – and I’m gutted to have such limited cooking abilities. With a long-term home on the agenda, one of the first things I’m going to do is pick up a handful of recipe books and start recreating my favourite dishes from around the world.;;;;;;;;;

To Gain Confidence With my Spanish;;;;;;;;;
I’d always been confident in my Spanish language skills until I spent time in Mexico and Spain. Suddenly, people (not locals) were laughing at how I spoke Spanish with a British accent and asking why I don’t use a Spanish accent. And it knocked my confidence so hard to the point that I barely utter a word when I’m in Spanish-speaking countries; I’m too embarrassed to speak. These days, I stand awkwardly and understand everything that’s going on, but keep my lips firmly sealed.;;;;;;;;
Last year, I worked hard on not caring about what people think of me, and this is one of my few remaining hangups I can work on. I’ll be spending a month in Oaxaca at the start of the year, then potentially moving to Spain a few months later, so there’s no excuse.;;;;;;;;;

What?!;;;;;;;;;
I know. I swore I would never write another book after the first one destroyed my mental health, but this one will be different. I’m keeping it under wraps for now, but I can tell you that it’s about travel, I’ll be self-publishing, and it’s not a memoir. I hope to release it within the first six months of 2016.;;;;;;;;;
Create Detailed Resources on Never Ending Footsteps;;;;;;;;;
This year, I want to work on sharing the expertise I’ve gathered from five years of living the nomadic dream. Like how to travel when you have anxiety. Or a detailed guide to what to pack and what to leave behind. Or how to travel long-term. Or how to work from anywhere. I’m talking 10,000+ word resources that contain everything I know about a topic.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
2016 is the year where I start producing helpful content as well as narratives about my disasters.;;;;;;;;;
Get My Work in Big Publications;;;;;;;;;
I’ve created a list of ten magazines, newspapers, and websites that being featured in would blow my mind, and another list of ten major publications I’m confident I can write for. I suck at marketing myself and actively avoid putting my words in front of another site’s audience, so 2016 will be all about growing my confidence by getting featured in new places.;;;;;;;;;
To Switch Up My Social Media Focus;;;;;;;;;
I’ve always been a Facebook/Twitter kind of girl, but I’m starting to feel their limitations. Twitter is fun but sends so little traffic, and my Facebook reach declined by half a few months ago. It’s time to widen my horizons, and I’ll now be focusing my energies on Instagram, Pinterest, Youtube, and Snapchat as well.;;;;;;;;;
My Instagram account has been sorely neglected from the day I created it, but I’m proud of my engagement levels there. My photos gain between 150 and 250 likes from an audience of 3,000 followers, but 3,000 isn’t great. By the end of the year, I’m hoping to have 20,000. I’m excited to start sharing a mix of my favourite travel photos and what I’m currently up to!;;;;;;;;;
Pinterest is another site I’ve been neglecting, but I’ve become obsessed with it over the past few months. I’m also terrible at it. I think almost all of my blogging buddies cite Pinterest as their highest referrer. Me? I get 100 visits a month. By the end of 2016, I’m hoping for 50,000 monthly referrals. Aim high!;;;;;;;;;
Youtube is another area I’m going to focus on. After my packing video went somewhat viral, I find my channel with 150,000 views, 1,100 subscribers, and people emailing me every few weeks to tell me they found my video, was inspired to quit their job, and have been travelling ever since! All that from one video and a site I haven’t signed into for a year. This year, I want to start producing high quality Q&A videos. To put some numbers on it, I hope to get a minimum of 25 videos uploaded and grow my audience to 5,000 subscribers.;;;;;;;;;

Finally, Snapchat, which I love because I can give you live updates of my travels and disasters! I’m especially excited to snap my way around the South Pacific on a budget — the beaches are going to be incredible! I’m nefootsteps over there if you want to follow along on my adventures.;;;;;;;;;
And that’s it for my 2016 goals! I’m excited to start kicking ass and start creating a life that’s healthier, happier, and full of balance.;;;;;;;;;

Let’s face it: it doesn’t sound like that exciting a place. I didn’t know anybody who had been, I knew very little about it, and pictured it as an island blanketed in factories and filled with electronics.;;;;;;;;;
I was delighted, then, to discover that Taiwan is all about the beautiful beaches, spectacular scenery, delicious street food, and some of the friendliest people I’ve ever met. After spending four weeks on the island while on that first trip, I’ve since paid two additional month-long visits to this kickass country. Yes, I’ve spent three whole months in Taiwan and I’m still keen to return to explore further.;;;;;;;;;
Having spent so much time in this wonderful place, I feel qualified to share how much you should budget for a trip there, especially as I’ve tried out several different travel styles during each visit.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve spent a month travelling solo on the tightest backpacker budget I could manage, and averaged $22 a day.;;;;;;;;;
A month travelling as part of a couple in mid-range-priced guesthouses, and averaged $35 a day.;;;;;;;;;
And a month as a digital nomad, basing myself in an apartment in Taipei for a full four weeks, and averaged $50 a day.;;;;;;;;;
Let’s take a look at how much of my expenses I spent on accommodation, transportation, food, and activities. First up: how to travel in Taiwan on a backpacker budget!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How to Travel Taiwan on a Budget;;;;;;;;;
Taiwan was my first destination in Asia and the first place to show me just how affordable backpacking could be.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Rather than staying in the cheapest dorm room I could find, like I had been doing in Europe, I could afford to book the highest-rated hostel in town, because it was $10 a night; I could head to a street market and find an entire meal for a couple of dollars; I could take a train across the length of the island for the price of a 30-minute journey back home in the U.K.;;;;;;;
I spent $599.82 in 27 days. That’s $22.22 per day! ;;;;;;;;;
Let’s take a look at my budget breakdown to see how affordable travel in Taiwan can be.;;;;;;;;;
How to Save on Accommodation in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
If you’re looking to stretch your dollar as much as possible, aim to stay in dorm rooms in hostels. For some reason, private rooms in hostels and budget guesthouses in Taiwan are strangely expensive — often as much as $50 a night, whereas you’ll be able to grab a dorm bed for around $10 in most places. If you’re a solo traveller, dorm rooms are definitely the way to go, and hostels in Taiwan are clean, modern, and great value for money.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve stayed in so many hostels in Taiwan over the three months I’ve spent travelling there, so I’ve put together a list of where I most recommend staying (all prices are listed in USD, as that’s where the majority of my readers are based):;;;;;;;;;
Taipei: A six-bed dorm in Flip Flop Hostel at $15.00/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        Flip Flop is the best hostel I’ve stayed at in Taiwan! It’s full of amazing and welcoming staff, is located in a central area beside a metro station, great street food, and a park, and the beds are clean and modern with your own lights and power socket, which is always great. When I was feeling lonely one day, one of the staff members invited me to dinner at his grandmother’s house, which definitely shows how welcoming everyone else! Check out prices and availability here.;;;;;;;;;
Taichung: A six-bed dorm in HoSin Hotel at $9/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        HoSin Hotel is such good value for money, at only $9 a night! If you’re going to check out beautiful Sun Moon Lake while you’re in Taiwan, Taichung is the best place to base yourself, as it’s very expensive to stay beside the lake. HoSin Hotel has fast Wi-Fi, a kickass games room, an ATM within the hotel, and is in a great location close to the train station. Check out prices and availability here. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Kaohsiung: An eight-bed dorm at Pathways Hostel for $12/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        If only every hostel was as wonderful as Pathways! I booked a three night stay here based on the incredible reviews and wasn’t disappointed. The staff are what make staying in this hostel so great, as they’re always only too happy to help out with any questions and offer plenty of recommendations. Given that they offer a free breakfast, have a free water dispenser, and free lockers, this hostel offers exceptional value for money. Check out prices and availability here. ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tainan: A seven-bed dorm at 365 Hostel for $18/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
365 Hostel is a little pricier than everywhere else I stayed in Taiwan, but if you can afford it, I think it’s worth staying here over some of the more cheaper options in the city. It’s in the perfect location for exploring Tainan, there’s so much incredible local food within walking distance, and the beds are seriously comfortable. Easily one of the best hostels in Tainan! Check out prices and availability here. ;;;;;;;;;
Hualien: An eight-bed dorm at Sleeping Boot Backpackers for $11/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        What I loved about Sleeping Boot Backpackers was the friendliness of the owner (yes, this is a common theme in Taiwan!) When I ended up in a dorm room on my own, the owner took me under his wing and showed me all around Hualien. Without asking for anything in return, he told me to get on the back of scooter and introduced me to local food, took me to a cultural performance, and asked for nothing in return. The dorms were quiet, clean, and well ventilated, and you were within walking distance of everywhere you’d need to go in the city. You can also rent scooters here to take around Taroko Gorge. Check out prices and availability here. ;;;;;;;;;
How to Save Money on Transportation in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
I used a mix of transportation in Taiwan, ranging from daily metro trips in Taipei, to hopping on a local train around the country, to checking out the high-speed rail between Taichung and Kaohsiung. If you’re on a budget, local trains are definitely the way to go. Here were my costs:;;;;;;;;;
Ten days of metro use in Taipei: $3.60;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Local train from Taipei to Taichung: $12.03;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
High-Speed Rail from Taichung to Kaohsiung: $26.13;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Local train from Kaohsiung to Hualien: $17.43;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Local train from Hualien to Taipei: $13.00;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How to Save on Food in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
Food in Taiwan is cheap, thanks to the plethora of night markets in every city. I always recommend eating the local food and doing so on the streets. Not only is the street food safe, but you’ll gain a cultural insight into Taiwanese life, too. In fact, the only time I got sick in Taiwan was when I ate in a restaurant rather than at a street food stall. Most dishes are around $1-2 per meal at the markets, so local is definitely the way to go!;;;;;;;;;
For food, I paid $248.56 for four weeks of backpacking across Taiwan. That works out to $9 a day.;;;;;;;;;
How to Save Money on Activities in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
The great thing about Taiwan is that many of the activities you’ll want to do in the country are free.;;;;;;;;;
Entry to Taroko Gorge is free, as is the entrance to the Kaohsiung temples, as is the entrance to Sun Moon Lake, as is the entrance to the temples I visited in Taipei.;;;;;;;;;
The only things I paid for in Taiwan was my bus tour around Taroko Gorge ($7.92) and my minivan tour of the Lotus Pond temples ($4), making my activities budget extremely low for my four weeks of travel.;;;;;;;;;
While I limited most of my activities to free things, like hiking, prioritising museums with free entry, and wandering through markets on foot, Viator does list several budget tours that I’m planning to take when I next travel to Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;
I definitely want to jump on this Taipei street food tour ($18), as Taiwanese food is one of the most underrated cuisines on the planet and I’ve always wanted to delve deeper into the food scene. I also love the sound of this Taroko Gorge tour ($33), too. If you’re not confident on scooters, having somebody else show you around and explain the significance of the different trails is a great way to explore one of the prettiest parts of Taiwan. Finally, I’m totally adding this small group tour to the northeast coast of Taiwan ($33) to my next itinerary for Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Mid-Range Couple Budget;;;;;;;;;
Several years later, I returned to Taiwan, but this time with my boyfriend in tow. My budget had expanded over that time, too, and I was looking to stay in either private rooms in hostels or budget guesthouses. When it comes to transportation, my boyfriend and I travelled across the island in much the same way as I had as a backpacker, and definitely still ate mostly street food! Activity costs were low once more.;;;;;;;;;

The Cost of Mid-Range Accommodation in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t stay in dorms while I was travelling in Taiwan this time around, but we did opt for a mix of private rooms in hostels and budget hotels. Here’s what the costs looked like for us (this is for the total cost of the room, rather than just my share):;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Taipei: JV’s Hostel at $50.30 per night;;;;;;;;;
Kaohsiung: Century Hotel at $37.26 per night;;;;;;;;;
Kenting: Bicycle Inn Hotel at $23.14 per night;;;;;;;;;
Hualien: Is Life Minsu Hostel at $32.98 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Transportation;;;;;;;;;
Transportation was similar to my first visit: a mix of metro use in Taipei, the High Speed Rail, local trains for much of the rest of the country, and a scooter rental in several places. Here’s my breakdown in detail:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
High speed train from Taipei to Kaohsiung: $46.70;;;;;;;;;
Return ferry ride from Kaohsiung to Qijing Island: $1.58;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Kaohsiung to Kenting: $10.15;;;;;;;;;
A day’s scooter rental in Kenting: $9.50;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Kenting to Kaohsiung: $10.15;;;;;;;;;
Train from Kaohsiung to Hualien City: $17.65;;;;;;;;;
A day’s scooter rental in Hualien: $12.66;;;;;;;;;
Train from Hualien City to Taipei: $13.74;;;;;;;;;
Taipei metro costs for our 10-day stay: $10.93;;;;;;;;;
Return bus from Taipei Airport to Taipei: $9.06;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food;;;;;;;;;
Food was vastly different to my first visit! With my eating horizons now having widened to roughly 18 million times the size they were before, I dove headfirst into night market eating and surfaced several hours later with a duck tongue in my mouth. Dave and I ate mostly on the streets when it came to lunches and dinners, but usually headed to a cafe for a bread-based meal for breakfast.;;;;;;;;;
My total food costs came to: $525.41.;;;;;;;;;
Activities;;;;;;;;;
Once more, many of the activities we did in Taipei were free, like access to Taroko Gorge, Kenting National Park, Yingge Ceramics Museum, and exploring the temples of Lotus Pond.;;;;;;;;;
The only entrance fee we paid was for Taipei’s Museum of Contemporary Art, which was $1.58.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The-Basing-Yourself-in-Taipei Budget;;;;;;;;;
Taipei is fantastic for digital nomads! If it wasn’t for my extrovert boyfriend needing to know roughly 7,984 people in a city in order to keep his energy levels high, we would have seriously looked at making it our home base.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

For this particular trip to Taiwan, we spent our entire month in Taipei. We booked out an Airbnb apartment for 30 days, didn’t even leave the city for any day trips, and spent the vast majority of our time eating our way around the city.;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation;;;;;;;;;
Our Airbnb apartment came to $27.28 per night, or $54.56/night when you include Dave’s share, too. We were in the heart of the Xinyi district, a few minutes’ walk away from Taipei 101, surrounded by dozens of cafes and restaurants, and my favourite night market in the city: Tonghua!;;;;;;;;;
Transportation;;;;;;;;;
No real transportation costs came up during the month.;;;;;;;;;
We used the metro to get around and I paid $3.25 for a month’s worth of rides. We also paid $15.00 each way for a transfer from and to Taipei’s airport.;;;;;;;;;
Food;;;;;;;;;
Street food galore! Our main reason for being in Taipei was to eat, and because we didn’t really have much of a kitchen in our apartment, we ate out for every meal. There were lots of date nights, lots of visits to international restaurants, and many, many wanders around the night market. Western breakfasts in cute coffee shops were around $7, lunches at restaurants in shopping malls and international restaurants around our neighbourhood were roughly $10 each, and our evening meals were predominantly from Tonghua night market and were around $4 a meal.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent $650 on food for the month.;;;;;;;;;
Activities;;;;;;;;;
All of our activities (mostly hiking in the nearby mountains, walking in parks, and wandering around markets) were completely free in the city!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that’s how much it costs to travel in Taipei! To summarise, these are my daily costs for these different travel styles (so that means only my share of the accommodation is included):;;;;;;;;;
Solo backpacker on a tight budget: $22.22 per day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As part of a couple on a mid-range budget: $34.71 per day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As part of a couple based in Taipei for a month: $50.03 per day;;;;;;;;;

What. A. Month. I don’t even know where to begin.;;;;;;;;;
Over the past four weeks, I continued to stuff my face with delicious brunches in Melbourne, took myself offline to spend time with Dave’s family in New Zealand, and kicked things into high gear with a solo trip to the mind-blowingly beautiful Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is PARADISE!;;;;;;;;;
Swoon.;;;;;;;;;
I wrote a lot about my time in Melbourne in last month’s summary, so I’ll kick off this one with my trip to New Zealand.;;;;;;;;;
I think I must have cursed myself by publishing my travel lowlights for 2015 before the end of 2015, because of course I managed to squeeze in one final incident before the year was out.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t know how it happened: laziness, probably, but two hours before our flight to Christchurch, I suddenly discovered that I hadn’t actually bought a ticket for our flight.;;;;;;;;;
What am I even doing in life?;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, I managed to find a ticket at the last minute and our ride to Melbourne’s airport resulted in one of my favourite photos of me and Dave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
With my newly-purchased ticket to Christchurch firmly in hand, I boarded a different plane to Dave and made my way to Ashburton, Dave’s hometown that is as happening as a place can be that has a store called the Denim Den. And also: Annie’s Country Quilt Store.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
As you can probably gather, this trip to New Zealand ended up being vastly different to my previous visit. Rather than racing around the famous spots and cramming in as many activities as possible, this time we took it slow. I visited only Ashburton and Hanmer Springs — not exactly places on the tourist radar — and I spent my time hiking, eating, and then gaping in horror at my rapidly-turning-black toenail because I hadn’t realised my hiking boots were too small for me.;;;;;;;;;
Views over the Canterbury Plains from our Woolshed Creek hike;;;;;;;;;
In fact, I had one activity on my agenda for New Zealand and that was hiking the Kepler Track. Which we then called off within a day of arriving. A southerly (i.e., antarctic) wind was blowing through the South Island at the time and the thought of hiking through snow, or cold rain, or in single-digit temperatures was all we needed to hear to cancel our plans.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Instead, we opted to walk from Woolshed Creek on the Mt Somers Track, a beautiful hike that’s popular with locals and nobody else. The track we followed can be split up over three days, but we did the whole thing in one, and, oh my god — it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.;;;;;;;;;
Views from the St James Walkway;;;;;;;;;
From Ashburton, we moved to Hanmer Springs, where I strapped on my hiking boots and stumbled my way along part of the St James Walkway. Then I fell over. And then my toenail turned jet black.;;;;;;;;;
And that was the end of my hiking career in New Zealand. Afterwards, I spent my remaining time in the country eating, sunbathing, and visiting the hot springs.;;;;;;;;;
Next stop: the Cook Islands!;;;;;;;;;
Favourite viewpoint in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
Everything I’d read online told me to leave Rarotonga as soon as possible and spend the majority of my time in Aitutaki, so I could hardly believe how incredible the beaches were on the former. Wasn’t this supposed to be the least impressive island?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent two nights on the west coast of the island and one on the east, exploring the island on foot, hunting down cheap eats, and swimming in the warm waters of the lagoon.;;;;;;;;;
Cheap eats in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
I threw up an hour before my flight to Aitutaki — I don’t know why — so that made the journey to the airport interesting. But not abnormal, because I’ve come to realise that everything seems to go wrong when I travel alone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But the second I arrived? I gulped down the remnants of my vomit and smiled. I had just realised why exactly everyone says to leave Rarotonga as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is seriously impressive.;;;;;;;;;
The highlight from my stay had to be the full-day lagoon cruise that was all about the snorkelling and visiting islands that I was convinced were photoshopped, even though I was burying my toes in their sand.;;;;;;;;;
I’m not one for boat cruises, because I get seasick and I hate snorkelling, but this one was so worth it. If you go to Aitutaki, you have to go on a lagoon cruise. I don’t know if I’ll ever visit anywhere as beautiful as this again.;;;;;;;;;

Flying in French Polynesia: always spectacular!;;;;;;;;;
With my time in the Cook Islands over, I hopped on a plane to Tahiti, where I spent as little time as possible (the best parts of French Polynesia are elsewhere), and onwards to Maupiti, a small island with friendly locals and a guesthouse owner who didn’t turn up to the airport to pick me up.;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I’ve written about how I’ve been battling with anxiety for the past couple of years, and it’s been hanging around ever since.;;;;;;;;;
This month, I finally managed to put it all behind me and it’s all thanks to my solo trip in the South Pacific. As always: pushing myself out of my comfort zone is so amazingly good for my anxiety, as much as I don’t want to do it at the time. As soon as I left Dave’s side and had nobody to rely on but myself, I somehow ended up feeling stronger than ever. I wasn’t broken, after all. I wasn’t having a breakdown I’d never be able to recover from. I just needed to start doing the things that gave me panic attacks to prove that I was more than capable of doing them and doing them well.;;;;;;;;;
Now, I feel confident, I have zero anxiety, I’m so far away from having a panic attack, and I’m at the point where I don’t expect to have another one for a very long time.;;;;;;;;;
Solo travel: it is so freaking great if you suffer from anxiety. I can’t let myself forget that again.;;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
The three nights I spent at Ranginui’s Retreat in Aitutaki.;;;;;;;;;
I booked this guesthouse because it said it had free Wi-Fi in the listings online, but I arrived to discover they charged a whopping $10 per 150 mb. My room had to be the most uncomfortable I’ve ever stayed in. It was so goddamn hot that I spent most nights in tears because nothing I could do would cool me down. I tried sleeping on the floor next to the freezer with the door open, I opened every window and door, I sat in front of the fan, I showered under ice cold water while wrapped up in the sheets. Nothing worked. It was budget travel at its absolute worst and I couldn’t wait to leave.;;;;;;;;;

Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
As always, when I travel solo, I always rack up an incredible number of incidents. This trip was no different. Rather than focus on one specific incident, I’m going to list out everything that went wrong over the space of my week in the South Pacific:;;;;;;;;;
I got sunstroke. I threw up. Somebody put their hand through my window while I was sleeping and touched my head. I fell off my bike. The bike was such poor quality, it destroyed the nerves in my hands — they tingled and ached for five days straight. I got seasick. I slid off the side of a boat, but got my bikini bottoms caught on a hook and ended up dangling over the water with a massive wedgie. Everybody on my tour saw my vagina. Our boat broke down in the middle of the ocean for an hour, with no shelter from the sun and no respite from seasickness. I caught two colds. I got a weird rash all over my body. I’m currently convinced I have dengue fever. My bank blocked my debit card. I had to deal with a stalker in Tahiti who I discovered had been following me all over Aitutaki and wanted to follow me to Maupiti. My guesthouse in Maupiti forgot I was arriving, leaving me stranded at the airport. And then, when I finally found them, told me they’d lost my booking and were fully booked.;;;;;;;;;
Jesus.;;;;;;;;;
But there are worse places to be cursed.;;;;;;;;;
Instagram of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I’m focusing on improving my Instagram account this year, and I’m excited to share my progress in my summaries! This month, my most popular photo was taken on the flight over to New Zealand, and rocked up 524 likes.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Thanks to the generosity of Dave’s friends and family, I didn’t have any accommodation costs in Melbourne and New Zealand.;;;;;;;;;
Rarotonga: $117.38 over 1 night = $39.13 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I stayed in two different places on Rarotonga. The first was Rarotonga Backpackers, on the west coast of the island, which came in at $25 for a dorm and $35 for a private single room. The staff were friendly, it was easy to meet people and make friends, and there was a swimming pool and a gorgeous beach out front. The only downside was the worrying reports of robberies along the stretch of beach outside. If you stay there, make sure you keep your valuables in the lockers or your room!;;;;;;;;;
On the east coast of the island, I stayed at Raina Beach Apartments and loved it even more, though it came in at almost $60 a night. It was located opposite Muri Lagoon, which is one of the prettiest parts of the island, and the apartment was enormous. Great location, friendly staff, cheap eats nearby: it was great!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki: $205.64 over 4 nights: $51.41 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I also stayed in two different places on Aitutaki. The first was Ranginui’s Retreat. See above for my not-so-wonderful experience.;;;;;;;;;
Next up was Gina’s Garden Lodges, which was so much better. I wish I had stayed here from the start. For $50 a night, I had an enormous bungalow with five beds! Gina was lovely, even giving me a hug when she sent me off at the airport, and the bungalows were peaceful and surrounded by jungle. The room was spacious, had a huge balcony, working Internet, and a big kitchen for cooking at home.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tahiti: $24.40 over 2 nights: $24.40 per night;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In Tahiti, I stayed at Pension Te Miti, a fairly standard hostel on a nice stretch of beach. I booked it for the free airport transfer (and free breakfast) as I was only staying for a night on the island. It was clean, the owner was cool, and the beach in front was nice. Not amazing, but good for a cheap stopover.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maupiti: $74.35 over 1 night = $74.35 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Note: the $75 included a large breakfast and dinner, so covered all of my meals on the island. In Maupiti, I stayed at Pension Espace Beach and absolutely adored it! The staff were friendly (although nobody spoke even a word of English, so I had to communicate through the other guests), the room was modern and clean and located on the best beach on the island. The food was delicious! Any downsides? The fan wasn’t particularly powerful and the showers were cold water only. The Wi-Fi was free and fast.;;;;;;;;;

My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
I have an action-packed stint of travel coming up over the next month!;;;;;;;;;
I’ll be starting with a continuation of my Society Islands jaunt in French Polynesia: after Maupiti, I’ll be heading to Raiatea, Huahine, and Bora Bora, researching how to visit the islands on a budget and cramming in as many fun activities as possible;;;;;;;;;
Then: The Worst Travel Day Ever.;;;;;;;;;
From Bora Bora, I fly to Tahiti and onwards to Auckland, where I’ll spending the night sleeping on the floor of the airport. Next stop: Fiji. I was originally planning on spending ten days exploring the Yasawa Islands, but I’ve decided to cut them from my plans and hit up Nadi on a 48 hour layover. Why? I’m tired and this trip was too ambitious with too much movement. I miss Dave. I miss sitting still. I miss being able to write on Never Ending Footsteps.;;;;;;;;;
After those two nights in Fiji, I’ll be taking an overnight flight to Los Angeles, spending the entire day at the airport, then taking another overnight flight to Mexico City — landing at 3 a.m., which I’m sure will be wonderful.;;;;;;;;;

After spending many years wandering head-first into disaster and surviving it all (usually) in one piece has taught me that everything works out okay in the end.;;;;;;;;;
And that has made me lazy when it comes to planning.;;;;;;;;;
I no longer feel the urge to sit down and figure out the logistics of every single activity and travel day. Instead, I think to myself, ah, I’m sure there’s a way to do it.;;;;;;;;;
There usually is.;;;;;;;;;
After successfully dodging the worst attempt at a bribe in history at the Belize-Guatemala border, Dave and I now had to figure out how to get to El Remate — the small village where we’d be basing ourselves as we explored Tikal. My travel experiences up until now had shown me that if I needed to get somewhere, it’d be easy to find someone who was willing to take me. Especially when I stood out so clearly as a tourist.;;;;;;;;;
Sure enough, a guy wandered up to us just minutes after we’d entered Guatemala and asked where we were going. He agreed to take us the hour-long journey in his minivan and we negotiated the price down to a reasonable 7 USD. After stopping at a small store to change our Belizean dollars into Guatemalan quetzales, we piled into the back of his colectivo.;;;;;;;;;
I sat transfixed as we made our way past trees, lakes, and military checkpoints, then were dropped off at the nearest intersection to El Remate. From there, it was just a fifteen minute walk to our accommodation.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We were staying at La Casa de Don David, a gorgeous guesthouse with an enormous tree, a lakeside location, and a secluded bar where the drinks were served via a zipline from the main restaurant. I still think of this guesthouse as one of my favourite places I’ve ever stayed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We’d arrived late in the afternoon, which gave us not very long to figure out a plan of attack for Tikal. The majority of visitors opt to see it as part of a tour, but you’ve probably realised by now that I try to do things independently if at all possible. Organised tours aren’t really my thing.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, it was easy to do this with Tikal. The guesthouse ran a shuttle to the park at 3:30 a.m. (gulp) to get us in at the 4 a.m. opening time. Eight hours later, they’d pick us up and bring us back to the guesthouse.;;;;;;;;;
That sounded pretty perfect to me!;;;;;;;;;
Well, aside from the whole waking up at 3 a.m. thing.;;;;;;;;;
We stayed awake just long enough to catch the sunset over Lake Petén Itzá, then turned in for the night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We emerged into the early morning darkness several hours later and shivered our way into the minivan. I alternated between dozing in my seat and gazing out at the break of dawn, wondering if it was always quite so foggy at this time in the morning.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t see more than a few metres in front of me.;;;;;;;;;
We paid the entrance fee and shuffled inside. If anything, the clouds of fog seemed to be thickening as we made our way towards the Temple of the Jaguar, chosen to be our first spot for no other reason than it was the only structure we’d heard of.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We hurried our way down a small path, then entered a large clearing. And there it was, standing in front of us: the reason why people visit Tikal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was, um, magnificent?;;;;;;;;;
So, honestly, guys? At this point, I was starting to wonder why on earth we’d woken up at 3 in the morning when we couldn’t even really see anything. Was this normal?;;;;;;;;;
But we’re positive people, and the one great positive to the bad weather was that everyone else who was there at this time quickly disappeared into the mist and were free to explore the ruins alone.;;;;;;;;;
I mean, sure, we could barely see them. But how often do you get to be somewhere like this and have it all to yourself?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We clambered over the hazy ruins for a couple of hours until we came across Temple IV, which is the highest pyramid in the park. We made our way to the top of the 230 ft structure for something to do, having no idea that it was best place to be for sunrise.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At the top, we squeezed our way out onto a ledge, with only a few other couples around for company.;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t the best view, of course — we could still only see about ten metres in front of our faces, but the sounds more than made up for it. We sat breathlessly and listened to the jungle come alive, howler monkeys and spider monkeys and toucans all singing out as the sun fought an ongoing battle with the clouds.;;;;;;;;;
It felt like the most magical moment of my life, and I had no idea that the best was yet to come.;;;;;;;;;
As if someone had pushed a button, the fog started to lift. Gradually it turned from dense clouds to thin wisps, then raised up from the canopy and burned off within minutes. As Dave and I sat and watched with our jaws agape, gradually our visibility increased.;;;;;;;;;
Suddenly, we could see a temple poking up through the treeline! And then another. And another. We’d had no idea that any of them were there. It was like putting on glasses and suddenly seeing the world in a different light.;;;;;;;;;
The sky turned from a light grey to a vibrant blue in the space of 15 minutes, and it felt as though all of Tikal had been revealed to us.;;;;;;;;;
It was a privilege to have been in the right place at the right time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I convinced Dave to remain sitting up there with me for half an hour more, because I wanted to commit this magical sight to memory.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Which I’m glad I did, as I would later lose all of my photos and videos of this experience.;;;;;;;;;
By the time we descended, there were hundreds more people exploring the park, and I realised we’d made the right decision to visit the most popular spots early. Now, we could head for the less popular temples and experience them just the two of us.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Well, almost the two of us.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We also got to share the ruins with an ocellated turkey, alternatively known as a jungle turkey and found only in the Yucatan, Belize, and Guatemala. Its vibrant colours immediately made it my new favourite animal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But then I discovered coatimundis, which knocked the ocellated turkeys off the top spot. When viewed from far away, they kind of looked like mini brontosauruses, if you pretended their upright tails were actually their necks.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Which I did, and then giggled about for a solid hour.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And there were a whole host of other animals to hang out with, too. Like this little guy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One thing I don’t regret doing is returning to the Jaguar Temple once the fog had cleared.;;;;;;;;;
Our visit had been disappointing before, but now that I got to see it in all of its glory, with bright blue skies behind it, it ended up being the highlight of my visit.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We continued to explore Tikal for a few more hours, ticking off most of the lesser-visited sites. It turned out we’d planned our visit well by hitting up the more popular spots first and then saving the less popular ones for when the crowds had descended. We probably ran into less than a dozen people after heading off the main trail.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Which is pretty remarkable, considering we didn’t plan at all.;;;;;;;;;
When it came time to leave, we’d spent eight hours inside the park and I knew we hadn’t managed to cram in everything. But I was satisfied with what we did see.;;;;;;;;;
It was time to head back to La Casa de Don David and spend the rest of the afternoon lazing in hammocks and ordering our drinks via zipline.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back at the border the next day, I gazed longingly back towards Guatemala. I’d loved our time in the country and had immediately connected with it in a way I’d yet to do so in Belize. Dave and I even spoke about how, if we hadn’t left our backpacks behind at our guesthouse in San Ignacio, we’d have most likely continued on through Guatemala rather than returning.;;;;;;;;;
Still, we had ten days to see the best Belize has to offer and then we’d be back. I was already plotting out adventures for when we’d return.;;;;;;;;;
Rather than exchanging my wad of quetzales at the border, I folded them up and placed them carefully in the pocket of my jeans. I was looking forward to using them again soon.;;;;;;;;;
Little did I know, just days later, we’d be cancelling our return to Guatemala, as well as the rest of our trip through Latin America.;;;;;;;;;

I’d just finished up an intense island-hopping adventure around the South Pacific, and was exhausted, stressed, and ready to hit pause on my travels for a while.;;;;;;;;;
Luckily, I found the perfect two places to do exactly that.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d originally planned to spend time in Oaxaca back in 2014, when I spent a full six months travelling around Mexico. With an unusually cold snap in the air that winter, though, Dave and I voted for skipping anywhere at altitude and heading straight for the beach.;;;;;;;;;
It was the right decision for us at the time, but man, I’d always regretted not getting to eat my way around that beautiful mountain city.;;;;;;;;;
So from the moment I touched down until the moment I left, I did my best to try as many foods as possible. There was the life-changing chilaquiles sandwich — not exactly authentic Mexican food, I know, but amazing nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There was the delicious octopus and avocado tacos from the taco stand across the road from our apartment. Only $1.50 each!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
And the colourful vegetarian tostado from our local organic market.;;;;;;;;;

I had high hopes for my time in Oaxaca, and spoke eagerly and often about taking a trip out to see the Monte Albán ruins and the Hierve el Agua rock formations. Did I manage to see either of them? Nope!;;;;;;;;;

Sometimes you don’t realise how stressful a situation has been until you stop, and pausing my fast-paced travels in Oaxaca knocked me on my ass. As did the altitude. I spent most of my time in Mexico with various colds and ear/sinus infections, and panting whenever I moved more than a few steps.;;;;;;;;;
But I loved this beautiful city and know I’ll be back soon. The next time, I’ll hopefully be rested, full of energy, and eager to explore!;;;;;;;;;
But first: a layover in Dallas, where I scouted out the most American meal I could find.;;;;;;;;;
From Oaxaca to Seattle, which is one of my favourite cities, and one I could see myself living in if I had a different passport.;;;;;;;;;

Travel blogging friends Steph and Mike were heading to Japan for a month and asked if we would be interested in dogsitting for their adorable pooch, Leo, while they were gone. I think I took all of about 3 seconds for me to reply with: YES!!!!!!!!!;;;;;;;;;
And then I let Dave know that we would be going to Seattle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And oh my god, what a fantastic time I had with my new furry friend!;;;;;;;;;
It’s funny, because growing up, I never had any pets, and when I first started travelling I was pretty anti-animals. I’d never spent any time around them, and dogs had always intimidated me.;;;;;;;;;
Slowly, though, I began to discover just how amazing they are, to the point that I now basically want to adopt every single dog I see.;;;;;;;;;
And Leo was the best dog of all.;;;;;;;;;
During my time in Seattle, I got to tuck him into bed every night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And sometimes we even napped together.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Some days, I confused him by sitting in his bed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And whenever it rained outside, we snuggled up together on the sofa with blankets.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We grew to become chill-out partners in crime.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, what did we get up to in Seattle when we weren’t obsessing over Leo? Well, we were staying in the super-cool Capitol Hill area, and spent a lot of time checking out a whole load of restaurants and bars. We also got to hang out with travel blogging friend Jessie for the first time, and my best bud Diana flew out to spend a few days with us.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
One highlight from my month was getting to attend my first football match outside of the U.K.! We watched the Seattle Sounders play for a good half an hour until a torrential downpour had us fleeing for shelter, because Seattle. But regardless, it was a fun evening, and I was shocked by how passionate and loud the Sounders fans are!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, I found the perfect church for someone with a brain like mine.;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Is it really going to be any surprise if I say hanging out with Leo? I fell hard for that dog and love him as if he were my own. Six months on, I still can’t stop talking about how amazing he is, and showing people photos of him, and speaking proudly of all of the good times we shared. I know that’s ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;
Maybe it’s time for me to halt my travels and get a dog?;;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Month 56 kicked my immune system to the kerb, which was hugely disappointing. During these four weeks, I battled a seemingly never-ending stream of infections, culminating in several traumatising visits to doctors in Seattle when I developed a bladder infection that was resistant to all but two types of antibiotics.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And it sucked, guys. I freaking love Seattle and I wanted to spend my time eating and drinking my way around the city, going for runs, and hanging out with friends who were in town. While I managed quite a bit of that, I also ended up in pain for a significant chunk of my trip.;;;;;;;;;
It was this month that confirmed it was time for me to end my full-time travels. The stress and exhaustion was making me seriously unwell and I knew it wasn’t going to improve unless I made a serious change in my life. My failing health was a huge sign that this lifestyle wasn’t working for me anymore.;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I’ve racked my brains and I really can’t think of anything that happened this month, which is definitely a first for me!;;;;;;;;;
Instagram of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I think I posted photos of my South Pacific trip for about six months straight on Instagram, because those paradise island shots always do so well! This is still my most popular Instagram photo of all time, racking up a whopping 1,323 likes!;;;;;;;;;

My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve got a much more exciting month coming up next!;;;;;;;;;
After finishing up the remainder of my stint in Seattle, I’m jetting over to the U.S. South to begin a music-themed road trip with my family. On the cards are visits to New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, and Miami!;;;;;;;;;
And then, a flight to Lisbon, where I’m planning on spending a month, or maybe longer.;;;;;;;;;
We’ll see how I like it ;"-)""";;;;;;;;
"1623407997-399,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/19"",""Fitzroy is Home to the Best Brunches Ever"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/best-brunches-fitzroy-melbourne/"",""Fitzroy is Home to the Best Brunches Ever"",""August 15, 2020"",""It’s hard to believe now, but when I first visited Australia back in 2012, I left the country claiming that Melbourne was the place I’d liked least.";;;;;;;;;
There weren’t been any super-famous landmarks to check out like in Sydney. The beaches weren’t as great as the ones in Tasmania. The skyline was boring. It felt like just another big city; somewhere to do some shopping. I came away feeling like it had very little to offer tourists, even going so far as to recommend readers skip over it if they had a limited time in the country.;;;;;;;;
Having said all of that, I’ll fully admit that I did many things wrong in terms of sightseeing during my first visit to Melbourne. We were in the city to spend time with Dave’s family over Christmas and ended up housesitting in the sprawling suburb of Point Cook, over a half-an-hour’s drive from the city centre. We didn’t have a car.;;;;;;;;;
Instead of exploring the inner city, we stayed mostly in the suburbs. We got some work done. We hung out with Dave’s family. We went for walks around the strangely silent streets lined with identical houses. On the odd occasion that we made our way downtown, it was on New Year’s Eve when everything was closed, or to replace our clothes at an outlet mall, or to meet one of Dave’s friends for Vietnamese food before heading straight back.;;;;;;;;;
Why didn’t we make an effort to see more? Because this was Dave’s time to see his friends and family and I wasn’t going to try to take him away from them. After all, whenever we spend time in London, we’ll often spend weeks at a time in boring Staines, so that I can maximise friend and family time. I don’t want to waste a day looking at the Houses of Parliament when I could be hanging out with people I only see once a year.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To me, Melbourne came across like a place to live rather than a city to explore as a tourist, and my month spent living in the suburbs was, um, not as exciting as I might have hoped.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave was kind of gloomy when he discovered how disinterested I was in Melbourne — it had been his home for three years before he started traveling and he was invested in me falling in love — so this time around, we resolved to do something about it. It just so happened that our return to Australia coincided with one of Dave’s friends taking a trip away, and that was how we found ourselves housesitting once more, but this time, in the hipster Fitzroy neighbourhood.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
These days, if you were to ask me where my favourite place in Australia is, I’d answer Melbourne without a moment’s hesitation.;;;;;;;;;
I love it. I love Fitzroy. I love vibrant Brunswick street, full of vintage clothes stores and second-hand bookstores and record shops and oddities. I love that it’s full of hipsters and hippies. I love the super-cool street art you can find on every street. I love the Victorian architecture; that every building looked crumbling yet beautiful and bright.;;;;;;;;
I love Fitzroy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve always said I could never live in Australia. it’s too isolated, and too expensive — both in terms of living costs and as a base to travel from. But after my time in Fitzroy, I found myself eagerly researching the price of apartments. I couldn’t believe it, but I was on the verge of committing to living there.;;;;;;;;;
And the one thing that tipped me in favour of doing so? The food.;;;;;;;;;
In Fitzroy, I spent an entire month gorging myself silly on the best brunches of my entire life. No exaggeration.;;;;;;;;;
These are my favourite spots.;;;;;;;;;
Rustica Sourdough;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Is this not the best looking French toast you’ve ever seen? ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I’ll fully confess to visiting Rustica Sourdough solely because I’d seen a photo of this exact dish online and wanted to see if it was just as beautiful in real life. Verdict? Yes. Yes, it was.;;;;;;;;;
So what’s on this colourful plate of awesome? Those two slices of French toast came complete with chocolate brownie-flavoured ice cream, fresh berries, vanilla mascarpone, raspberry compote, popping candy, and dozens of colourful flowers. It was delicious and actually not as sickly as I expected. But kind of weird as a breakfast food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And this was what Dave decided to go with: matcha cured salmon, horseradish aioli, crispy potatoes, a boiled egg, and rye sourdough!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The brioche French toast cost A$16.50 and the matcha cured salmon came to A$19.00.;;;;;;;;;
Industry Beans;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I very nearly turned into a smashed avocado during my month in Melbourne, and my absolute favourite version came from Industry Beans. Located down an alleyway in an area that’s smothered in vibrant street art, it provided a quiet alternative to the restaurants on busting Brunswick Street.;;;;;;;;;
Industry Beans’ smashed avocado comes with creamy goat’s cheese, charred lemon, green tea sea salt, a poached egg, and two slices of sourdough. So hipster. So great.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Another one of my favourite brunch dishes here was the tamarind blue crab with crispy prawns, shredded green apple, lychees and a Thai omelette. Dave and I both agreed it tasted like something you’d find in a fancy restaurant in Chiang Mai!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Also, I have to give a shout-out to Industry Beans’ fantastic coffee! I hate 95% of the coffees I try, but Dave’s flat white was so smooth and creamy that I immediately ordered one for myself.;;;;;;;;;
The avocado smashed eggs is priced at A$20.50 and the blue crab was A$22.00.;;;;;;;;;
Breakfast Thieves;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Is Breakfast Thieves not the best name ever for a breakfast place? Dave opted to try out The Legend: spicy baked eggs with Spanish hot chorizo, mushrooms, and feta, served with herbed garlic toast.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As for me, I decided to go with The Leprechaun, because I am short. It was all about the sweet corn & herb fritters on spiced tarka dal, along with coconut and yogurt labneh, crisp-fried chickpea, and poached eggs.;;;;;;;;;
Both dishes were priced at A$19.50.;;;;;;;;;
Gutz;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If I had to choose my favourite breakfast cuisine in the world, there’s no question that it would be Turkish. There was also no question, then, that we’d head to Gutz, which specialises in Turkish breakfasts.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My favourite was the menemen, which was just as good as any I’d had while travelling through Turkey. Gutz’s version came with sautéed onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers, mixed in with herbs and scrambled eggs, and served with wood-fired Turkish bread. I may have returned three times in a week and ordered the menemen every time!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This was Dave’s favourite dish: the eggs benedict, which came with poached eggs, grilled ham, and hollandaise sauce on sourdough, along with a side of baked beans. Nom!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At Gutz, the menemen is priced at A$16.00 and the eggs benedict is A$15.90.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I came to Fitzroy with a sullen face, convinced that Melbourne was the worst. Who knew that by the end of my month, I would be excitedly planning a future where I moved to Fitzroy and put on 73 kilograms within my first year?;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;

After a quiet Christmas in Guanajuato, it felt like mild culture shock to arrive in one of the biggest tourist destinations of the Caribbean coast, full of loud parties, thousands of tourists, and a plethora of English-speaking locals.";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We decided then that we’d be using Playa del Carmen as our base for exploring the Yucatan. We spent our time climbing the ruins of Coba and Chichen Itza, sunbathing on one of the best beaches in Tulum, swimming with sea turtles in Akumal, and eating our way through Valladolid.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The one thing that had been missing from our explorations? An island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Isla Mujeres is found a few miles off the Caribbean coast, accessible via a short ferry ride from Cancun. The island is long and skinny — four miles in length but only 600 metres in width — and is a laid-back former fishing village, full of colourful buildings, surrounded by crystal clear waters, and a place where the primary method of transportation is a golf cart.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hey, guys! Have I ever told you I get seasick?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The twenty-minute-long ferry ride over from Cancun wasn’t as bad as I’d expected, but like most minor movements, left me feeling like the world was spinning and i wanted to get off. If you’re mega-prone to motion sickness like me, pop a few pills before you leave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our trip to Isla Mujeres was a Christmas present from Dave, so we were mid-range-ing it up for a few days in the pretty Hotel Belmar. It was centrally-located on Hidalgo Street, which is the main strip on the island. It’s full of restaurants, bars, and one really annoying busker who always showed up right as I commenced my afternoon nap.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Isla Mujeres is split into three distinct areas: the north, where we were staying, is the touristy part of town. You’ll find tons of restaurants and busy white sand beaches with the clearest water you’ve ever seen. Head further south and the middle of the island is where you’ll find the locals. It’s much quieter here, with small, family-run cafes and expat communities making up the majority of the land. Head further south still and there’s little development: small guesthouses, vibrant turquoise waters, and a small Mayan site to explore.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We opted to stay in the north because, well, we are tourists.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and because this beach was a five-minute walk away.;;;;;;;;;

Eat Street Food;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You guys know I’m not exactly the most experienced of eaters, but while I was in Mexico, I was approached by a Latin American food magazine about writing a series of articles about Mexican street food. I was terrified, but treated it as the perfect excuse for widening my food-based horizons and sampling dishes I’d usually shy away from.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This also meant that the majority of my time in Isla Mujeres was spent trying to work out how to describe food.;;;;;;;;;

The meat was… brown! It tasted… meaty! And cooked. It tasted like it was cooked. And meaty. I… liked it?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Brown and meaty. It tasted like… a taco? These chorizo tacos came with cilantro, onion, tomato, rice, and a lime to squeeze all over it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Marquesitas are a traditional Yucatecan dessert. I opted for the chocolate and condensed milk version — the vendor smothered a waffle in both, then rolled it up so I could pretend I was a wizard.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Expelliarmus!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tamales! This version had shredded pork inside with red and green hot sauce drizzled on top. So good!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Rent a Scooter and Go Exploring;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Isla Mujeres is perfect for exploring on two wheels. We toyed with the idea of renting a golf cart, but at $55 a day compared to $25 for the scooter, we opted for the latter.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

Snap Photos of Garrafon Natural Reef Park;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our first stop was Garrafon Natural Reef Park, located near the southern tip of the island. There, you can go ziplinging and snorkelling, and there’s a swimming pool and hammocks to hang out in. We toyed with the idea of going in, but decided to spend our time scootering instead. Plus, they offer dolphin swimming activities, which we’re both firmly against, and we didn’t want to support it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Instead, we stopped for a while to marvel at the ridiculous colour of the water as people ziplined their way over it.;;;;;;;;;

Check out Joysxee Yland;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Joysxee Yland is a floating eco-island comprised from 150,000 plastic bottles. For around $4, the owner will you give you a tour of his home. He wasn’t around when we rocked up, so we settled for taking some photos instead. While I’d hate to spend my life floating and vomiting, I think this is such a great way to promote recycling and conservation!;;;;;;;;;

Explore the East Coast Beaches;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The east coast of the island is all about sheer cliff faces and rocky beaches. Unlike in the north, we didn’t see a single person on any of these ones. Scooter along the main coastal path and stop off whenever you spot somewhere beautiful (likely every few minutes!);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

Grab Lunch in the Colonias;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As you’re heading back up to the north, take a left turn when you hit the middle of the island and you’ll find yourself in the colonias, where the majority of the locals live.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We stopped off at Mango Cafe for delicious fresh fish tacos for lunch before hitting the road once more, and I highly recommend it. This part of the island was full of vibrant colourful buildings and had a very different feel to the north.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

People Watch in the Town Square at Night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After watching the sunset on Playa Sol, head to the town square for some street food and people watching. The food options here range from corn on the cob to tacos to tamales to huge slices of flan for less than a couple of dollars each.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I would often grab a few tacos and settle down on a bench to watch the locals chat outside the church, while their kids would dance on the wooden makeshift stage.;;;;;;;;;

The Things I Should Have Done;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our trip to Isla Mujeres was all about relaxing and soaking up those final moments in Mexico before we moved on to Belize.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There were things I really wanted to do, but could never seem to get my ass into gear enough to actually arrange anything. It’s that kind of place.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Whale watching is something I’d be sure to check out next time I’m there. During May to November, the southern coastline can sometimes see as many as 400 whale sharks visiting at once!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s a turtle farm you can visit, too, where hatchlings are kept and protected until they’re released into the sea, drastically improving their chances of survival.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And how can I forget the underwater museum of sculptures?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Overall;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Isla Mujeres isn’t an undiscovered paradise that’s free of tourists — after all, it’s only twenty minutes from Cancun! But it is a relaxing getaway if you’re looking to explore somewhere where life moves at a slower pace. The buildings are colourful, the food is good (although double the prices of most places on the mainland), the beaches are beautiful, and the water breathtakingly blue.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

"Have you been to Isla Mujeres? Where’s your favourite island getaway?""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408103-434,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/16"",""Welcome to Belize"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/welcome-to-belize/"",""Welcome to Belize"",""October 27, 2016"",""Hey, remember that time I got a book deal and had to drop everything to work my ass off for well over a year? ";;;;;;;;;
Well, that happened back in 2015, when I had just arrived in Belize! Thanks to all of the stress and mayhem I had going on in my life at that time (and ever since!), I never got a chance to write about my time in Central America. Over the next week, I’ll be sharing everything I got up to on my first visit to Belize and Guatemala.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After six months in Mexico, my visa was days away from expiring and I knew it was time to leave.;;;;;;;;;
But I wasn’t ready.;;;;;;;;;
We’d come to Mexico as part of an ambitious and lengthy journey across Latin America. Over the space of a year, we’d be travelling through every country in Central America and the most South American ones, too. We were hoping to round it all off with a trip to Antarctica.;;;;;;;;;
Mexico had been just the start of this journey. We’d figured we’d check out a few places for a couple of months, then start travelling south, but we’d fallen hard for the country and never really got around to planning our departure.;;;;;;;;;
Six months later, it was our visas, not our hearts, that were making us leave.;;;;;;;;;
Our final stop in Mexico: Isla Mujeres!;;;;;;;;;
Next stop: Belize.;;;;;;;;;
There was only one direct bus from Cancun to Belize and it left at 10:15 p.m.;;;;;;;;;
And if that sounds like a recipe for not much sleep, that’s because it was. Add in a 4 a.m. border crossing on top of that and there was little chance of us arriving in Belize feeling fresh and rested.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and don’t forget to throw an intense questioning session at the Belizean immigration at 5 a.m. either!;;;;;;;;;
Let’s just say my first experience of a Latin American border crossing was both tiring and memorable.;;;;;;;;;
We pulled up at the border right on time and piled out of the bus. Fortunately, Dave had researched what crossing the border involves several days before and was well aware of the money-making scheme they have on the Mexican side.;;;;;;;;;
Basically, there’s a man sat in a small room who tells you that you need to pay a 300 peso ($16) exit fee. What most people don’t know is that if you flew into Mexico, you’ve most likely already paid this fee — for the vast majority of people, it’s already been included in your airfare.;;;;;;;;;
We’d printed out a copy of our tickets that itemised this fee, so were able to escape double-paying, but nobody on our bus had even heard of this rule. If you can’t prove you’ve already paid, there’s no way of getting out of it at the border.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I thought that would be worst of the crossing and settled in for a nap while everyone else on the bus argued to try to get out paying the exit fee.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
An hour later, we were moving again, and pulled up on the Belizean side to get our passports stamped.;;;;;;;;;
“How long did you spend in Mexico?” a woman snarled at me.;;;;;;;;;
“Six months,” I told her.;;;;;;;;;
She flicked through my passport to check.;;;;;;;;;
“Did you work while you were in Mexico?”;;;;;;;;;
I shook my head. “No.”;;;;;;;;;
“How could you afford to spend six months there?”;;;;;;;;;
“I’m taking a gap year,” I told her, which is my usual backup plan for whenever I receive questions at immigration. I’ve actually never been asked before, but the story I’ve perfected is that I’m a student, I’m taking some time out after studying to travel, and then I’ll be heading back to the U.K. to get my PhD. I look mega-young for my age anyway, so it’s not like it’s totally farfetched.;;;;;;;;;
And having said that, I mean, I’m not doing anything wrong by entering these countries while working online. I work for companies that are based in the U.K., I’m paid in pounds, I’m not taking jobs from any of the locals in the countries I visit — I’m just spending my money there.;;;;;;;;;
But that’s not a conversation I want to get into with an immigration official at the border, and especially not at 4 in the morning.;;;;;;;;;
“How long are you going to be in Belize for?” she asked.;;;;;;;;;
“Two weeks.”;;;;;;;;;
“Where will you be visiting?”;;;;;;;;;
“Belize City, San Ignacio, Placencia, and Caye Caulker.”;;;;;;;;;
“Are you going to be working in Belize?”;;;;;;;;;
“No.”;;;;;;;;;
“Did you work in Mexico?”;;;;;;;;;
“No.”;;;;;;;;;
“Where do you work?”;;;;;;;;;
“I’m a student.”;;;;;;;;;
“Where are you going after Belize?”;;;;;;;;;
“Guatemala.”;;;;;;;;;
She placed my passport down on the desk and began asking Dave the exact same questions.;;;;;;;;;
Everyone else on the bus had passed through immigration with a stamp and nothing more, but for some reason, Dave and I were held up for half an hour with her intense questions.;;;;;;;;;
Eventually, the woman grumpily smeared a stamp across our passports and waved us through.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We rolled into Belize several hours later, dusty, sweaty, tired, and with the knowledge that our travel day was far from over.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The main bus station in Belize City looked like a parking lot with a small ticket office and a waiting area behind iron bars. Despite our early arrival, the station was still swarming with people, and loud hip-hop music blasted out from a handheld speaker in a guy’s lap.;;;;;;;;;
As Dave and I shrugged at each other, a friendly guy approached us and asked where we needed to go. When we told him San Ignacio, he directed us to a battered old American school bus that was painted in a bright shade of turquoise. We pushed our way on board, shoved our backpacks onto the wooden shelves above our heads and squeezed onto the damp leather seat.;;;;;;;;;
All around us were laughing families, sleeping children, and teenagers playing loud, distorted music on their phones to each other.;;;;;;;;;
Instead of Spanish, the predominant language here was English, with Creole widely spoken, too. It felt odd to be able to tune into the conversations around me after flailing with my Spanish for the past six months, and I almost felt guilty for doing so. Like I was eavesdropping on conversations I shouldn’t.;;;;;;;;;
Belize felt more like the Caribbean than Mexico ever did — there was more of a laid back vibe, the music was all about the reggae, the food, I had heard, would now be primarily rice and beans. Belize was noticeably poorer, too, with rundown buildings lining the roads that our beaten-up bus juddered along.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A bead of sweat rolled down my back and I regretted the outfit I’d chosen for a night on the bus: jeans and a hoodie didn’t seem quite so sensible in the sweltering Belizean heat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our bus to San Ignacio was going to take several hours, so I slumped down in my seat and tried to tune out the chaos.;;;;;;;;;
That was a little tougher than I’d hoped. We were only a few minutes out of the bus terminal when a large woman pulled herself up from the front of the bus, turned around and passionately began to shout about the lord Jesus Christ to an enraptured audience. The entire bus burst into applause when she finished, including all the teenagers.;;;;;;;;;
We screeched to a halt.;;;;;;;;;
I shot Dave a quizzical look as dozens of people began rushing to the other side of the bus, smartphones in hand.;;;;;;;;;
Traffic had stopped, people were stood outside their homes and staring down the road, sirens were wailing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t until we continued driving several minutes later that I managed to see what had startled everyone so much.;;;;;;;;;
A dead body.;;;;;;;;;
It was sprawled across the road, towel over their head, t-shirt ripped to shreds. I spotted a leg twisted out at an awkward angle. As we inched closer, I winced as I saw a thick smear of blood and organs stretching from one side of the tarmac to the other. A smashed scooter was resting by the side of the road.;;;;;;;;;
I felt sick.;;;;;;;;;
It was a sobering experience, especially as Dave and I opt to spend so much time on scooters as we travel.;;;;;;;;;
I hoped it wasn’t an omen for the rest of my time in Belize.;;;;;;;;;
Ruins at Xunantunich, Belize;;;;;;;;;
We arrived in San Ignacio a little worse for wear, but I was instantly revitalised when I stepped off the bus. I only needed to take a few steps before I was engulfed in a swarm of butterflies.;;;;;;;;;
There were butterflies everywhere!;;;;;;;;;
As we walked to our guesthouse, all I could see was butterflies. And as we were staying a little way out of town, by the time we got to our guesthouse, all we could hear was silence.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was overjoyed to be in a brand new country. Especially with one as butterfly-filled as this.;;;;;;;;;
We got to our room, chucked our bags on the floor, and I sat down on my bed to catch up on everything I’d missed online.;;;;;;;;;
As I scrolled through Facebook, something popped up on my screen.;;;;;;;;;
An email with the subject line, Your Book.;;;;;;;;;
An email from a publisher who’d seen I was working on a book and wanted to take a look at what I had so far.;;;;;;;;;
"An email that was about to change everything.""";;;;;;;;;
"1623407979-394,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/19"",""Why I Will Always Travel With an Osprey Backpack"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/travel-osprey-backpacks-guarantee/"",""Why I Will Always Travel With an Osprey Backpack"",""October 6, 2019"",""Oh, man, this is going to sound really lame, but when I went shopping for my first backpack, I felt like I was Harry Potter picking out his wand.";;;;;;;;;
At first, everything felt wrong.;;;;;;;;;
Empty backpacks were surprisingly heavy and tugged on my shoulders, causing me pain within minutes of pulling them on.;;;;;;;;;
Front-loading packs were too wide and looked ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;
Backpacks I liked were too long for my tiny frame and dangled over my ass rather than resting on my hips.;;;;;;;;;
As I tried on and discarded uncomfortable backpack after uncomfortable backpack, I couldn’t help but feel like a fraud. It had to be a sign: how could I expect to travel the world when I couldn’t even find a backpack that fitted properly?;;;;;;;;;
But then: magic!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I threw an Osprey Exos 46 litre pack up onto my back and the world faded away, until there was just me and my backpack. I couldn’t believe how it could settle on to my hips and seemingly disappear. It was so light, I felt like I wasn’t even wearing it anymore. I felt as though I could fly. Just me and my backpack.;;;;;;;;;
“It’s The One,” I gasped at the bemused guy in the shop.;;;;;;;;;
And so it was.;;;;;;;;;
That backpack took me from Croatia to Russia, Taiwan to the Philippines, New Zealand to Malaysia, Serbia to Turkey, and fifty-odd countries in-between. Over and over, I’d insist people try it on and beam as they marvelled at how light it felt on their back. I didn’t realise it at the time, but I’d actually bought a hiking backpack designed for multi-day/month walks. Ha. But it was perfect for someone as lacking in strength as me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Most people who do any kind of travel find themselves quickly transforming into a minimalist when they realise how little they need to survive, and while I dabbled for a few years, my craving for more possessions than five t-shirts won out.;;;;;;;;;
After two years of living out of my backpack, I missed owning things. I wanted to be able to choose from more than two pairs of shorts, I wanted to travel with perfume and shower gel, rather than relying on a bar of soap to get clean. I wanted hair straighteners and a bulging makeup bag and two pairs of jeans and dresses for date nights and shoes that weren’t flip-flops. I guess I didn’t want to look like I was living out of a backpack anymore?;;;;;;;;;
It was time for an upgrade.;;;;;;;;;
Back in the U.K., I headed to an outdoor store once more and this time, opted for the Osprey Farpoint 70 litre pack, relishing in having double the space to fill with things. I’d learned a lot from my first backpack, too: the Farpoint was front-loading rather than top-, because the latter had grown to be a pain in the ass. Packing and unpacking through a small hole in the top of a pack is frustrating and time-consuming, and not being able to padlock anything had left me nervous about security, although nothing had ever been stolen from it. I also loved that it gave me The Overflow Pouch — a detachable daypack on the front of the pack that I never remove — instead, whenever I’m packing in a hurry, I shove a ton of things into The Overflow Pouch so I can pack in under two minutes flat.;;;;;;;;;

Like the Exos that came before it, my Farpoint took me around the world several times more, and it was perfect.;;;;;;;;;
Well, until Bangkok Airways ripped a hole in the side of it, that is.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, that was a problem.;;;;;;;;;
A problem that couldn’t be solved without an entire roll of duct tape, of course.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Number One Reason Why You Should Choose Osprey;;;;;;;;;
And now we get to the entire point of this post. I chose my Osprey backpacks based on comfort, but I’ll be sticking with them for their lifetime guarantee. From their site:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Osprey will repair any damage or defect for any reason free of charge – whether it was purchased in 1974 or yesterday. If we are unable to perform a functional repair on your pack, we will happily replace it.;;;;;;;;;
Sounds perfect, right? Hmmm. As a traveller, I’ve learned to take warranties with a grain of salt. Guarantees are great and all, but how would I take advantage of them if I was travelling through Mongolia and moving every couple of days? Many warranties require you to be in the country where you bought their product, and what if it takes up to 28 days to replace? It can be near-impossible to arrange things like this when you’re constantly on the move, so I always assumed I’d just end up buying a new backpack if it broke.;;;;;;;;;
The duct tape lasted me until Melbourne, where I had two weeks to see what happened. Tons of people have gushed about Osprey’s lifetime guarantee to me, but none of them had actually tried to get anything repaired or replaced.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s my personal experience with using Osprey’s warranty.;;;;;;;;;
Getting in touch with the international distributor was easy: I sent an email to the Australian distributor listed on Osprey’s international customer service page, explaining that I was currently travelling and that I needed a repair or replacement within eight working days. I received a phone call an hour later from them. They could repair my pack and turn it around within four days. Sweet as!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The repair guy was super-helpful: I drove out to the repair centre, where I met with the guy who’d be patching my backpack up. He ran through how he’d fix the pack — by replacing the entire side panel — then offered to use thicker material to patch it up so that it wouldn’t tear again.;;;;;;;;;
We’d have even been covered if we didn’t have a car: I wasn’t sure if I’d have access to a car to pick up the pack — I was travelling after all — once it had been repaired, but the guy reassured us that Osprey would courier the pack out to us for free if we couldn’t get there. That’s pretty cool.;;;;;;;;;
There are repair centres all over: You can find international distributors in Australia, Canada, China, all over Europe, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.;;;;;;;;;
Additionally, I dropped Osprey an email to see if I’d be screwed if my backpack broke in a country without an international distributor. Obviously they operate on a case-by-case basis, but the guy I spoke to said that it’s likely you could either have a replacement part shipped out to your location, or you could ship your broken backpack to a nearby country, get the repairs done, and have it shipped back out to you.;;;;;;;;;
While there are a few other backpack companies that offer lifetime guarantees, I couldn’t find any that would guarantee a repair or replacement backpack in pretty much every country around the world, and many of the policies excluded general wear-and-tear or if you’d been using it unreasonably or not taking proper care of it.;;;;;;;;;
Osprey covers you for absolutely everything, no matter what the cause and when it happened.;;;;;;;;;
I’m really happy with the repair: I have my backpack back and it stands out from the crowd on the luggage carousels!;;;;;;;;;

I was in a brand new country, and a beautiful one at that! And with a full two weeks to explore, I was convinced I could see a sizeable amount.;;;;;;;;;
First up on my agenda was tracking down some rocks to look at.;;;;;;;;;
While Mexico receives most of the attention when it comes to ruins, the Mayan kingdom reached down into parts of Central America, including modern-day Belize, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.;;;;;;;;;
By this point, I’d spent six weeks travelling through the Yucatan and I have to confess I was starting to feel ruined out, but after hearing that the ruins of Xunantunich were easily accessible from San Ignacio and were likely to be void of tourists, I knew I’d regret skipping out on them.;;;;;;;;;
And now, a pronunciation lesson: Xunantunich is pronounced shoo-nan-too-nitch.;;;;;;;;;
It means “stone woman” in the Mayan language, because the ruins are supposedly haunted. And I am glad I only discovered this just now while researching for this post. Back in the 1800s, people started spotting a woman dressed entirely in white with bright red eyes. She would appear in front of El Castillo — the main pyramid at the complex — climb the stone stairs and then disappear into a stone wall. No thank you!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Despite the complicated name, making the trip out to Xunantunich from San Ignacio required little brain power.;;;;;;;;;
Vibrant chicken buses crawl their way out of town every so often, and after 15 minutes of bumpy riding, a huge sign by the side of the road lets you know you’ve arrived. Total cost for the journey? 1.50 Belizean dollars or 75 U.S. cents.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From the bus stop, you’ll board a hand-crank ferry from the 50s that takes you across the bright green river whenever the operator feels like doing so. We handed him a small tip for our 30 second ride.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My boyfriend, Dave, and I were the only people to both get off the bus and board the ferry, so I was instantly struck by a sense of isolation. Once we reached the other side of the river, we were surrounded by trees and countryside, and aside from the paved road leading up to the ruins, few signs of civilisation. The only sounds were the trickling of the river and the buzz of crickets.;;;;;;;;;
I looked ahead, knowing we had a mile-long hike uphill ahead of us, then started walking.;;;;;;;;;
I’d read online that cars and pickup trucks often make the ride across the river and up to the ruins, and that you could most likely flag them down for a lift when they passed, but nobody else seemed to be visiting Xunantunich today. I walked in silence up to the ruins, feeling as though we were the only people for miles around.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of course, I was soon proven wrong when we got to the entrance and met the jolly woman at the ticket office. We handed over our 10 Belizean dollars entrance fee — 5 USD — and ambled inside.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And there was nobody there.;;;;;;;;;
I’d visited several Mayan ruins in Mexico in the month before heading into Belize, and every single one of them had been crammed full of people. While I’d assumed Xunantunich wouldn’t be quite so popular, I wasn’t expecting to have the entire square mile complex to ourselves.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out that Xunantunich isn’t a hugely popular destination for travellers, and even less so during the midday heat, when we were there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back when Xunantunich was at its peak, at around 800 A.D., it was a major ceremonial site, with something like 200,000 people living within an area of 75 square miles. The city consists of six plazas and more than 26 Mayan palaces and temples, all of which you can explore and climb all over.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What I found fascinating was that, until you reach the entrance to the complex, you’d have no idea these structures were even there. There’s so much jungle and wildness surrounding the site that you can’t see it until you’re right there inside of it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This was my favourite tree:;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We clambered over the smaller ruins for a while, before turning to the main attraction. El Castillo is the name given to the 40 metre high pyramid that dominates Xunantunich, and unlike its namesake at Chichen Itza, you’re free to climb all over it.;;;;;;;;;
So that’s exactly what we did.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The views from the top were breathtaking, and we could see the jungle sprawling for miles around. To the west, just one kilometre from Xunantunich, lay the Guatemala border, our next destination, and I spent a significant amount of my time gazing into the country with excitement.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Given the heat and the generally lazy theme of the day, Dave and I perched ourselves up on top of El Castillo for a full thirty minutes, taking photos of each other with the view and chatting about the fact that I’d just been contacted by a publisher and oh my god, did I really want to write a book about my many issues for the rest of the world to read and judge?;;;;;;;;;
For the entirety of that half an hour, we were the only people up there, and if I wasn’t starting to get sunburnt I could have spent a full afternoon taking in the view.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

Fun story! Dave and I had recently run out of sunscreen and popped into a souvenir shop to grab some. The only bottle they had on offer was *Mayan sunscreen*. It wasn’t until several days later, as we were rapidly getting more and more burnt that I bothered to look at the ingredients and realised the vast majority of it consisted of carrots.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you can see that white line in the distance, by the start of the hill, that’s the Guatemalan border.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We climbed back down the pyramid when a group of loud people joined us at the top, and opted to spend a few minutes lingering around the smaller ruins before heading back to San Ignacio;;;;;;;;;
As we wandered past the ruins and through the trees, I heard a deafening sound that chilled my bones.;;;;;;;;;
GREEAAARRGGGHHHHCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKK;;;;;;;;;
“What’s that?” I hissed urgently at Dave.;;;;;;;;;
The world began to spin as the only thing I could logically think about was that there was a dinosaur at Xunantunich, and it sounded hungry.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Have you ever heard howler monkeys before? If not, listen to the audio in this video that Dave took while we were there!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
They sound like freaking dinosaurs, right?!;;;;;;;;;
We stayed for a few minutes to take some video then quickly left.;;;;;;;;;
I am not a fan of howler monkeys.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Xunantunich: Well Worth a Visit!;;;;;;;;;
Long-time readers of the site will already be aware that I’m far more passionate about things that aren’t ruins when I travel — food, mostly — but I’ll still never deny my unexplainable compulsion to explore them. Even if I know — and I do — that I’ll most likely struggle to maintain my interest beyond a couple of hours, there’s always a small part of me that yearns to see them for myself.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

I was fortunate to visit several of the Mayan sites in Mexico: Coba, Chichen Itza, and Tulum, and while I’d possibly not name them my biggest highlights in Mexico, I was glad to have seen them.;;;;;;;;;
Xunantunich was one of my highlights of Belize.;;;;;;;;;
I’m a bit of a contradiction in that two of the things I love most when I travel are the incredibly famous, over-the-top-overly-expensive-and-overrun-with-tourists attractions, but also the places that few tourists choose to visit. I don’t go off the beaten track in particularly dangerous places, but if I don’t know anyone who’s been somewhere, and it seems safe, it immediately makes me want to check it out.;;;;;;;;;
Xunantunich checked the second box.;;;;;;;;;
We spent two hours in total checking out the ruins, and saw maybe half a dozen other people while we were there, too. After Mexico, I know how tricky it can be to explore Mayan ruins in solitude, but it was simple in Belize. The fact that it’s easily accessible from San Ignacio is just another bonus.;;;;;;;;;
So if you like ruins, or you like exploring kickass sites without the crowds, or you like monkeys that sound like enormous dinosaurs, come to Xunantunich! It’s a wonderful place to spend a few hours.;;;;;;;;;

I didn’t love Belize. ;;;;;;;;;
I’m in the minority here. Every person I know who’s been to Belize has returned singing its praises. Many of my friends count it among their favourite countries. As I’ve been writing posts about my travels in the country, so many of you have commented to tell me how much you love Belize. That it’s amazing. That you’d love to live there one day.;;;;;;;;;
It’s not that I didn’t like it.;;;;;;;;;
Belize is a beautiful country, filled with jungles and ruins, tons of wildlife, pretty beaches, and friendly locals.;;;;;;;;;
But it was expensive.;;;;;;;;;
Expensive in a way that felt like I was receiving poor value for my money.;;;;;;;;;
Belize is a small country that imports the vast majority of its goods, which obviously results in higher prices. This is then coupled with basic infrastructure, which makes it hard to get excited about what you’re spending your money on. Now, I’m fine with places being more expensive than I’m used to, but in Belize, it felt as though I was spending so much money on things I could get for far cheaper in neighbouring Mexico and Guatemala. In some places, I was spending what I’d expect to in the U.S.!;;;;;;;;;
Mexico was cheaper than Belize and had better infrastructure and food, in my opinion. Guatemala had a similar level of development, but was much more affordable.;;;;;;;;;
Whenever I hit the road, I’m thinking about finances. Mostly because I’m dedicated to recording every penny I spend. But as I explore a new place, I’m always weighing up whether it’s offering up good value for money. Sometimes I’ll be averaging $100 a day and feeling like it’s more than worth it; other times I’ll be spending a quarter of that and thinking, nope, no way.;;;;;;;;
Belize was a struggle for me because of that.;;;;;;;;;

For a long time now, I’ve had this idea in my head that Belize was over-the-top-expensive, but when I sat down to put this post together, I realised the prices no longer sounded so dramatic. These days, while I’d still notice I was receiving less for my money than in neighbouring countries, I don’t think it would be as much of an issue.;;;;;;;;;
But still, if you’re a budget traveller, Belize will be more expensive than its neighbouring countries, and you won’t receive as much for your dollars.;;;;;;;;;
Let’s get on with my budget breakdown for Belize! All prices listed are in U.S. dollars, as always, because most of my readers are based there.;;;;;;;;;
My Guesthouse room in San Ignacio;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Accommodation in Belize;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation in pricey in Belize, and we struggled to find a basic guesthouse room anywhere for less than $50 a night. We stayed in lovely guesthouses in San Ignacio and Placencia, and an Airbnb apartment in Caye Caulker. Prices for accommodation were slightly more than we were paying in Mexico, but the quality was only about half as good.;;;;;;;;;

I update this post with prices every three months and check the reviews to make sure I’m still recommending the very best options for you.;;;;;;;;;
River Park Inn, San Ignacio: $50/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        I couldn’t get enough of the guesthouse I stayed at in San Ignacio, and I highly recommend checking it out if you’re in Belize. The owner was unbelievably welcoming (we gave him our laundry and he secretly repaired all of our hole-riddden items for free!), and I loved hanging out in the hammocks while surrounded by colourful butterflies. It was like staying in paradise! There was A/C and Wi-Fi in the rooms. Search for the cheapest rates on HotelsCombined | Read reviews on TripAdvisor;;;;;;;;;
Seaspray Hotel, Placencia: $55/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Placencia is an expensive part of Belize, but Seaspray Hotel is one of the best budget options in town. For $55 a night, we had access to a beachside room (they have economy rooms for $33 a night) on the best stretch of sand in town. With beautiful views of the ocean and sunloungers to relax on during the day, this was an excellent choice, and well worth splurging on. They aren’t listed on any of the online booking websites, so you’ll need to book through their website. Read reviews on TripAdvisor.;;;;;;;;;
I’d probably go for a stay in Lydia’s Guesthouse in the future for my next visit to Placencia. They’re ranked first on TripAdvisor for best value B&B, are cheaper than Seaspray Hotel at $29/night, and still receive excellent reviews.;;;;;;;;;
Axios Sun Apartments, Caye Caulker: $52/night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
        Caye Caulker is the party hotspot of Belize, so you can expect to shell out extortionate amounts for a stay on the island. I’m talking $30 for a 6-bed dorm expensive here! The apartment we chose wasn’t anything amazing, so I’d recommend shopping around to find somewhere slightly better for the same price. I’d look to book Sea N Sun Guesthouse for $71 a night next time, or Blue Wave Guesthouse ($31 a night) if I was on a tight budget, as both receive excellent reviews.;;;;;;;;;

A typical bus in Placencia: you’ll be using these a lot if traveling on a budget in Belize!;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Transportation in Belize;;;;;;;;;
Public transportation was inexpensive in Belize, and I recommend taking the local buses over hiring a scooter or car, both for safety reasons and to save money. I saw somebody get killed on a scooter during my first day in the country.;;;;;;;;;
Distances are short, as the country is so small, but bear in mind that that doesn’t necessarily mean your travel days won’t be long and sweaty. A particularly memorable (read: awful) travel day saw us taking a full nine hours to get from San Ignacio to Placencia, a distance of 120 miles. It was a public holiday on that day and it turned out most of the country was trying to travel on that route, too! Thankfully, days like that were a rarity.;;;;;;;;;

Here’s what I spent on transportation in the country:;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Cancun to Belize City: $41.70;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Belize City to San Ignacio: $4.50;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Return bus trip from San Ignacio to Xunantunich: $1.50;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Taxi from San Ignacio to the Guatemalan border: $3.22;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Taxi from the Guatemala border to San Ignacio: $3.22;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus from San Ignacio to Belmopan: $7.50;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Belmopan to Placencia: $7.50;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus from Placencia to Belize City: $15.00;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Return ferry ticket from Belize City to Caye Caulker: $17.50;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Food in Belize;;;;;;;;;
The price of food in Belize was fairly steep and more in line with what you’d pay in the U.S., rather than neighbouring Mexico or Guatemala. Hunting down street stalls would get you a meal for around $5, but if you want a sit-down meal for dinner, you’ll looking in the region of $15-20 per person.;;;;;;;;;
I spent $417 on food for my 13 days in the country, which worked out at $32 a day. ;;;;;;;;;
Exploring Cahal Pech;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Activities in Belize;;;;;;;;;
I was all about the ruins in Belize! One of the cheapest activities in the country is clambering all over the ruins, so we made sure to do exactly that while we were based in San Ignacio. In Placencia and Caye Caulker, I opted to spend my time sunbathing and exploring on foot to save money. Here’s how much I spent on activities and entrance fees while I was in Belize:;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Entrance fee for Xunantunich: $5;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Entrance fee for Cahal Pech: $5;;;;;;;;;
Not much, hey? One of my greatest regrets about my time in Belize was not feeling as though I could justify spending money on some of the pricier activities in the country.;;;;;;;;;
One of the big-ticket items that everybody insists you have to do while in Belize is take a tour of the ATM caves ($110). This full-day experience takes you through the jungle, where you’ll swim through caves, ford a river, and learn about the Mayan civilisation. I regret not taking the tour because as the reviews show, practically every single person says it ended up being one of the highlights of their trip.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re not on a budget, you may want to work in a trip to Belize’s barrier reef, whether it’s snorkelling the Belize Barrier Reef ($75) or taking a helicopter over the Great Blue Hole ($420). If you’re not going to be venturing into Guatemala on your trip, it also might be worth opting for a day trip from San Ignacio to the magnificent Tikal ruins ($150). I absolutely adored my day spent exploring Tikal, so highly recommend taking the day to see as much of it as possible from Belize, especially as that tour receives fantastic reviews.;;;;;;;;;
Tobacco Caye looks pretty close to perfect!;;;;;;;;;
Don’t Forget About Travel Insurance for Belize;;;;;;;;;
Now, I’m always urging you guys to get travel insurance for every single trip for one specific reason: to be covered during medical emergencies. I’ve seen enough injured backpackers begging for money on GoFundMe because they weren’t insured and need to pay tens of thousands of dollars to cover medical treatment to know it’s a risk that’s never worth taking.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance is a travel essential, and given that I witnessed somebody dying in Belize, I definitely want to encourage you guys to ensure you have it. Travel insurance will cover you if somebody steals your laptop, if your flight gets cancelled, or if you suddenly come down with appendicitis. I’ve been using and recommending World Nomads insurance for travellers for six years and counting, and they’ve always been a pleasure to deal with.;;;;;;;;;
I paid just $15 for my two week trip to Belize, although it was part of a longer trip, which helps keep the insurance costs low.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Transportation: $101.64;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food: $417;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Activities: $10;;;;;;;;;
And all of that totalled $858.14 for a 13-day trip to the country. That works out at $66 per day.;;;;;;;;;

I couldn’t wait to show them around my new home.";;;;;;;;;
I’d been saving all of the most touristy activities in Lisbon for when they were here, so I was thrilled to finally get to discover what brings most people here.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s what we got up to!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Their visit was timed with the Euro 2016 championship, so we started off our explorations in Praça do Comércio, one of the main squares in Lisbon. There was a giant screen showing the matches, live music, and lots of food and drink stalls. I loved how Lisbon pulled out all the stops for every match, and nothing could beat the exhilarating experience of Portugal winning a couple of weeks later!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After a long walk beside the river, we made our way up through Alfama, the oldest district in the city. I love wandering around this part of Lisbon, because it’s full of maze-like alleyways, colourful and crumbling buildings, and bright fiesta streamers!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And hills, because Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next up on our list was a visit to Lisbon’s castle. I’d been snapping photos of it from below for several months by now, so it was definitely time for me to get up high and view the city from above. It turned out to be far better than I’d expected! It’s now one of my viewpoints of the city and somewhere I’m forever telling new visitors to Lisbon to check out.;;;;;;;;;
At this point, we had just enough time to pay a quick visit to the Time Out Market to grab dinner, then collapse in bed after a 10 hour day of sightseeing.;;;;;;;;;
Our next day of exploring was slightly more relaxed, as we were all exhausted from our action-packed previous day. We walked through Lisbon’s Botanical Gardens, wandered around one of my favourite parks, had a fish sandwich, and took a trip into Estrela in search of the best pasteis de nata in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, it was during this weekend when Brexit struck and what should have been a perfect, joyful visit was overlaid with a general sense of malaise and dismay. I think my anxiety reached peak levels after the referendum, and if there was ever a moment I could point to where I hit rock bottom with my mental health, it was now. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I felt sick, I had stomach cramps, I was spending all day inside, crying and hyperventilating. I was close to getting Dave to take me to a hospital.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t a great time to be alive.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, that all changed when I started the Whole30.;;;;;;;;;
Guys, this is the single best thing I have ever done in my life. I cannot praise or recommend it enough.;;;;;;;;;
It’s thanks to the Whole30 that I’m now anxiety-free and have been for four months and counting.;;;;;;;;;
It’s thanks to the Whole30 that I no longer suffer with hayfever. I used to have to take many, many antihistamines every day throughout summer to stop my face swelling up like this.;;;;;;;;;
And it’s thanks to the Whole30 that I no longer get severe motion sickness. Who knew that was related to my diet?;;;;;;;;;
At the start of month 60, I can’t even tell you how broken I was. I put on a brave face here and on social media, because who wants to read endlessly about someone’s breakdown? Behind the scenes, though, I was suffering.;;;;;;;;;
Basically, the stress of writing my book absolutely wrecked my mental health and over the past 18 months, I haven’t been able to find a way to recover. In a recent post, I summarised my year up until the Whole 30:;;;;;;;;;
I spent Christmas with Dave’s family locked in a bathroom crying. I spent the evening of my birthday sobbing, having panic attack after panic attack. I spent my few days on Bora Bora hyperventilating on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. I had so much social anxiety and so little self-esteem in Lisbon that I couldn’t barely even leave the house to see friends. This year, I’ve had two sinus infections, two ear infections, a bladder infection that’s left me with awful chronic pain, a tooth infection, and eight courses of antibiotics. Never-ending stomach cramps, daily panic attacks, a mouth that’s permanently filled with ulcers, floaters in my eye, a twitching eyelid, and so much more.;;;;;;;;;
I tried everything to get better.;;;;;;;;;
Meditating multiple times a day. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Joining a gym and going five times a week. Cardio. Weight training. Yoga. Walking every day. Forcing myself to be unwaveringly positive about every aspect of my life. Announcing that my anxiety was over in an attempt to convince my brain it was. Starting a gratitude diary. Stopping travelling. Travelling more. Travelling on a budget, travelling to fancy resorts, travelling alone, travelling with Dave, travelling with my family. Converting the second bedroom in our apartment into a sanctuary full of candles, soft lighting, and lipsticks. Finding relaxing-sounding hobbies, like crochet. Adult colouring books. Aromatherapy. Keeping a journal. Talking about my struggles incessantly. Staying quiet and keeping myself distracted. Leaving my comfort zone. Remaining solely in my comfort zone.;;;;;;;;;

A typical meal on the Whole30: grilled salmon, soaked in extra virgin olive oil and lime juice, with tomatoes, zuccini, onion, and a bunch of herbs. Roast potatoes on the side, because of course.;;;;;;;;;
Enter: the Whole30.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t want to delve too deeply into my experience here, because I’m planning on writing about it in depth in a couple of weeks, but the Whole30 is basically an extreme version of paleo. No gluten, no grains, no dairy, no legumes, no sugar, no sweeteners, no additives, no alcohol — if something causes inflammation in your body, it’s out for the month.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So what can you eat? Lots of fresh meat and fish, fresh vegetables, potatoes, eggs, and fruit. You can drink water, sparkling water, or coffee with no milk or sugar. That’s about it.;;;;;;;;;
I feel like it’s important to say that I approached the Whole30 as the biggest skeptic in the world, especially after I learned it was an extremely strict version of the Paleo diet, which I thought was exclusively for douchebags.;;;;;;;;;
But I was desperate, so I put my judgements to one side and dove right it.;;;;;;;;;
I mentioned the three main benefits for me above, but there were plenty of others, too. Like a 15 lbweight loss, like having constant energy levels and no longer needing to nap every afternoon, like experiencing random rushes of euphoria throughout the day, like having amazing skin and healthier hair and brighter eyes, like experiencing a boost in productivity and motivation, like having a flat AF stomach when I went to bed rather than being so bloated that I looked six months pregnant. The excruciating pain I’d been battling post-bladder infection cleared up, too. And I stopped getting sick, too!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave decided to do the Whole30 with me, for no other reason than to be supportive and to give me the best chance of succeeding (best boyfriend ever), so I’m thrilled he experienced just as many amazing effects. He lost about 15 lbs over the month, his skin that’s been breaking out for as long as I’ve known him completely cleared up, and some painful long-term digestive issues he’s battled for over 20 years disappeared. Like me, he had more motivation and energy than ever before.;;;;;;;;;
You know me: I can never write about the positives of something without equally weighing up the negatives! The Whole30 wasn’t all amazing and there were plenty of struggles. It’s basically impossible to eat out during the month, as restaurant meals are very, very rarely Whole30 compliant, which killed our social lives. We met up with friends a few times, but when the only thing we could order was water, I felt like a jerk. Also, cooking 90 meals in 30 days takes up a lot of time. The first 10 days or so were tough. Really tough. I had flu-like symptoms for the first week as my body detoxed from all the sugar I used to love, my cravings were out of control, and I was so tired I could barely work. One day, I slept for 18 hours!;;;;;;;;;
But to finally be able to function in life and feel like a normal human being again more than makes up for those downsides.;;;;;;;;;
So, there you go. Apparently the paleo douchebags were onto something. Apparently, I’m now one of them.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
It has to be showing my parents around my beautiful new home! I’ve now met up with my parents on my travels for a road trip through the Pacific Northwest, for a music-themed trip around the Southern U.S., in Slovenia, and now in Portugal. I love that they’ve transformed into globe-trotters over the past few years, and getting to show them around some of my favourite places is always a delight.;;;;;;;;;

Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Brexit. Ugh. I still feel so utterly depressed about the result and fearful about how it will affect my future in Lisbon. I’m also frustrated that Portugal is now so much more expensive than when I moved here and that my savings are worth so much less. Gah.;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
The Saga of the Black Scabbardfish.;;;;;;;;;
Oh god.;;;;;;;;;
Another benefit of doing the Whole30 was greatly improving my skills in the kitchen. I mean, hey, if you have to cook 90 meals in 30 days, you’re bound to pick up some new tricks!;;;;;;;;;
I was enjoying leaving my comfort zone when it came to cooking, so I decided to branch out and grab a weird-looking fish at our fishmongers one morning. I had no idea what it was or how to cook it, but I figured it’d be reasonably straightforward. I’d been cooking a lot of fish.;;;;;;;;;
After a fair amount of googling, I discovered that what I had bought was something called a black scabbardfish. A rare and very ugly-looking fish that can only be found in the waters surrounding Madeira. It was also very, very tricky to descale.;;;;;;;;;
Dave spent an entire 45 minutes trying to descale this freaking fish, all while I was googling more and more about it and discovering some unsettling facts:;;;;;;;;;
Despite having huge market value and a strong hold in the typical Southern European diet, there are several health risks associated with consumption of the black scabbardish due to the presence of several toxic metals found within the fish including lead, mercury, and cadmium. Even in very small quantities, these metals can be deadly to humans if consumed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But wait, there’s more:;;;;;;;;;
The black scabbardfish is a suitable host for the parasite known as Anisakis. Consumption of raw or under cooked black scabbard fish can result in health complications for humans. The only reliable treatment for a human affected with Anisakiasis is the removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.;;;;;;;;;
What the hell had I just bought?;;;;;;;;;
And not only that, but after Dave had spent the better part of an hour wrestling with this goddamn fish, we began slicing it up and found a giant rusty hook buried inside it!;;;;;;;;;
And that was the end of our attempts to cook a black scabbardfish.;;;;;;;;;
We threw it out and went with some smoked salmon for dinner instead.;;;;;;;;;

My Next Steps;;;;;;;;;
After spending a couple of months settling into my Lisbon apartment, it was, of course, time to pack up my things and hit the road again!;;;;;;;;;

I’ve got a full summer of European travel ahead of me and I can’t wait to bounce my way across the continent over the next eight weeks.;;;;;;;;;
First up: a return to my beloved U.K. with a two-week long stint in Hackney, over in East London. Hackney doesn’t have the greatest reputation in London (understatement), but it’s quickly developing and compared to what Shoreditch or Brixton were like ten years ago.. Given that Dave and I regularly dream of one day being able to afford to move to London, we’re heading there to see if Hackney could be a possible base at some point.;;;;;;;;;
From Hackney, we’ll be heading north to Oxford: a place I’ve never been to before, and basically my first time venturing north of London while in the U.K.! Yes, really. Dave’s brother studies at Oxford University, so we’ll be paying him a visit for a few days. While we’re there, we’ll be checking out the architecture, having plenty of pub lunches, and wandering around the university grounds.;;;;;;;;;
After a few days back in Staines with my family, I’ll be jumping on a plane and flying over to Greece for my very first visit.;;;;;;;;;
"Woohoo! I’m excited to jump back in the travel waters again.""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408011-403,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/18"",""Flying in French Polynesia is Spectacular"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/flying-in-french-polynesia-photos/"",""Flying in French Polynesia is Spectacular"",""October 7, 2019"",""It’s no secret I’ve always struggled with flying.";;;;;;;;;
Which, yeah, is kind of ridiculous for someone who travels for living. I’ve taken well over a hundred flights during the past five years, but stepping on a plane makes me nervous. I’m practically guaranteed to dream about being in a plane crash the night before a flight.;;;;;;;;;
I hate relinquishing my sense of control, I start panicking whenever I look out the window and realise just how much nothingness there is between me and the ground, I’ve been known to start sobbing over a patch of rough turbulence, and I’m permanently bracing myself to come face-to-face with a hijacker.;;;;;;;;;
I know my fear is irrational. I know how planes work. I understand all the technical stuff. I know they don’t just fall out of the sky. I know that turbulence isn’t dangerous. I know that if flying was as unsafe as driving, there would be hundreds of crashes a day.;;;;;;;;;
I know all of that and yet, I still once wrote an overdramatic post titled Flying in the Philippines is Terrifying.;;;;;;;;;
What made it so terrifying? The planes were small and that made me feel nervous.;;;;;;;;;
Well, the planes were even smaller in French Polynesia, but I’ve grown up a lot over the past few years and I’m not as frightened these days. Thanks to a calmer disposition and a dog-eared copy of Cockpit Confidential (if you’re afraid of flying, you need this book!), I can usually spend my time on a plane feeling mildly uncomfortable rather than experiencing a full-blown panic attack.;;;;;;;;;
Which was great in French Polynesia, because flying there was spectacular. Every single flight took me over sharp volcano peaks, dense jungle, bright blue lagoons, and white sand beaches.;;;;;;;;;
Here are some of my favourites views from the window:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My very first glimpse of French Polynesia came when I passed over the island of Raiatea. I love this shot because it shows just how far out the lagoon stretches, and you can see a small yacht sailing in its waters.;;;;;;;;;

Tahiti is the most built-up island in French Polynesia, so this photo, taken as we were arriving in the capital of Papeete, gives you some idea of how untouched the rest of the islands are.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I return to French Polynesia, the island of Moorea is going to be right at the top of my list. I’d avoided it on this visit because I’d heard it was popular with tourists (I wanted to spend the majority of my time on lesser-visited islands), but places are popular for a reason. It looked stunning from above.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s another photo of Moorea. I couldn’t get over how many jagged peaks it has!;;;;;;;;;

Huahine was my favourite island in French Polynesia, and this photo was taken shortly after taking off. I spent much of my time on the island cycling around the small lagoon you can see alongside the runway.;;;;;;;;;

Even on a stormy day in Maupiti, the lagoon was still a vibrant shade of turquoise!;;;;;;;;;

What a fabulous month I’ve had, from celebrating Dave’s birthday in Cambodia to an action-packed jaunt through Vietnam, these past four weeks have brought the perfect blend of travel, rest, and play into my life.;;;;;;;;;
Let’s get started!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This month, I returned to Sihanoukville and my beloved Otres Beach, thrilled to discover it had remained just how I left it, with a chilled out vibe and an unspoiled beach. The ocean was warm; Bob Marley tunes were dominating; and the beach was deserted.;;;;;;;
Last time we visited, we were staying in a $15-a-night beach bungalow with holey walls, a cold water shower, and regular power cuts; this time around, I opted for something a little more upmarket.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Staying at Tamu Hotel was glorious, and I dove straight into that pool within minutes of checking in. We spent the next few days in a haze of blissful excess: of sun, of books, of food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We switched off all technology but our Kindles, revisited our favourite restaurants, and, unlike last time, successfully avoided the 50,000 jellyfish that had washed up on the sand.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next, we jetted up to Siem Reap for our final stop in the country. We’d both visited the main temples of Angkor before, so spent this trip seeking out the spots few people choose to explore. We asked our tuk-tuk driver to take us to his favourite temples — to show us the ones that weren’t swarming with people.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t sure it would be possible, so I was delighted we got to spend an entire day barely seeing another person. We clambered over rocks and scrambled up ruins, and visited temples that were just as impressive as the ones on the tourist route, if not more so because we had them all to ourselves.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How can you see Angkor Wat without the crowds? By visiting at sunset! When we turned up at around 5 p.m., we were met with a steady steam of people flowing out of the complex and onwards to one of the popular sunset spots.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We spent the next hour wandering in silence, and when the sun set, we clambered out of a window and sat perched on the small stone ledge as we watched the sky turn orange. There was barely anyone save for a couple of monks in sight. What an amazing experience!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
With that, our whirlwind trip to Cambodia was complete and it was onwards to Vietnam!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave’s parents decided to fly out to meet us for this portion of our Southeast Asia trip, and we had ten days to show them the best Vietnam has to offer. And to prevent them from getting run over.;;;;;;;;;
We failed on the tour guide front when it came to showing them around Hanoi: I’d never been and Dave had only spent a day there half a decade ago. Honestly, I arrived fully expecting to hate the city — I’ve read far too many posts on travel blogs stating that scams were everywhere and the people were rude — so I was surprised to fall deeply in love almost immediately.;;;;;;;;;
Nobody attempted to scam us and the people were just as friendly as they are in the south. I felt safe and welcome there. And the food!;;;;;;;;;
Vietnamese food is one of my favourite cuisines, so we booked a street food tour to learn more about the dishes Dave and I often struggle to find. I expected to love the tour but came away feeling disappointed. At $85 per person, it was pretty pricey, so to leave feeling ambivalent towards the experience was unexpected. Only one of the dishes was blow-your-mind delicious and I didn’t come away feeling as if I had any greater knowledge about Hanoi street food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We were on a rushed schedule, so flew down to Hoi An next, one of my favourite places in Vietnam. After the chaos of busy Hanoi, it was a welcome break for my overwhelmed mind. We spent our time relaxing by the pool, reading books, strolling through the beautiful old town, and even paid a visit to a silent cafe, which was basically my favourite place in the entire world. Fuck yeah, silence!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We rounded off our time in Vietnam with a whirlwind return to Saigon, which we spent indulging in avocado smoothies and banh mi, as always, and then it was off to Taipei, taking an illogical route via Singapore.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was here that I really took the time to put into practice the lifestyle I planned out for myself in my recent hitting the reset button post. For the first time in, well, ever, I managed to find the perfect mix of work, rest, exercise, and play.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

I’m starting to catch up on work on Never Ending Footsteps, afternoon naps are now making a daily appearance in my to-do list, my Fitbit is recording 20,000 steps on a regular basis thanks to my many hikes in the mountains surrounding Taipei, and I’ve been heading out to explore the tourist sites I’ve missed on previous trips, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And one final thing: this month, I heard from my publisher that How Not to Travel the World has sold out its first print run in just three months! According to my editor, it’s rare for a new travel book to sell out in under a year, so to do so in three months has well and truly blown my mind. Thank you so much to everyone who’s picked up a copy — I can’t tell you how grateful I am and how much your support means to me! <3;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
It has to be our first day back on Otres Beach! I loved laying out beside the pool, squealing at our enormous hotel room, splashing around in the ocean, and rounding it all off with a candlelit dinner at our favourite pizza restaurant.;;;;;;;;;

Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Falling in love with Vietnamese egg coffees (exactly what they sound like), drinking two in a day, and ending up with heart palpitations for hours.;;;;;;;;;
Vietnamese coffees are strong, and as someone who has the trifecta of being tiny, highly sensitive, and a lifelong caffeine-avoider, I was convinced I was going to die.;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
In Taipei, I sliced my finger open while doing the washing up! In yet another spectacular display of poor common sense, I decided to scrub our huge knife with the blade facing my hand. Of course, I slipped and the knife sliced straight through a good portion of my knuckles. Argh!;;;;;;;;;
There was so much blood that I was soaking through a thick wad of tissue every few minutes, and I was terrified I needed stitches. Fortunately not! At least I have an L-shaped scar on my finger now.;;;;;;;;;
My Favourite Photo;;;;;;;;;

Sunset at Angkor Wat was incredible! I love the reflections in this shot.;;;;;;;;;

The Best Thing I Ate;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve spent much of my time in Taipei seeking out the strangest cafes I could find. This concoction from Glam Air consisted of vanilla ice cream, cornflakes, popping candy, and an enormous candy floss hat that was placed on top. Drop it all inside a cup full of dry ice and your mystical dessert is good to go!;;;;;;;;;
Amount Spent;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Kampot: This was a birthday present for Dave, and he doesn’t want to know how much it was, so I won’t be sharing the price here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I opted to stay at RikiTikiTavi, because we’d stayed there last time and loved it. On our last visit, I was suffering from an infected wound on my leg and insisted we splash out on the fanciest hotel I could stumble to to recover. The rooms are clean and airy, with air conditioning and a large breakfast included. Happy hour overlooking the river is a must! You can book through their website.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Otres Beach: Also a birthday present for Dave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tamu Hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in. It’s been over a month since we visited and I still can’t stop talking about it. Our room was incredible, and so was the view, and so was the food, and can’t I go back and live there forever? Highly recommended if you’re looking to treat yourself on Otres Beach!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Siem Reap: Also a birthday present for Dave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I loved our stay at Chronicle Angkor Hotel. The staff were some of the nicest we’ve come across, and their Kitkat-accompanied goodnight note was the sweetest thing to have happened to me in a hotel. They helped us arrange a tuk-tuk, the breakfast was varied and delicious, and the swimming pool was wonderful to unwind beside. It was centrally located, but quiet. I loved it!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hanoi: $61.80 over 5 nights = $12.36 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bleh — Crystal Hotel Hanoi was one of my least favourite hotels I’ve ever stayed in! Our room smelt like damp mould, it was dingy and dark, and one of the staff members made sexist comments about me to Dave. Avoid!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hoi An: $115.84 over 4 nights = $28.96 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We opted for the Lantana Hoi An Boutique Hotel in Hoi An and loved it! We had a swimming pool to relax in, the staff were friendly, impressively memorising our names within minutes of our arrival, and we were a few minutes’ walk away from the old town. I liked it a lot.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Ho Chi Minh City: $27.10 over 1 night = $27.10 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
An average stay at the Tan Hoang Long Hotel. The hotel was nice and it was in a good location, but we ended up in a room without windows, which I hate. Meh. There are better places to stay in the city, and for much cheaper, too. I wouldn’t go back.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Taipei: $354.64 over 13 nights = $27.28 per night;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We’re spending our month in Taipei in this loft-style apartment with one of the best views I’ve ever had. We’re in the heart of the Xinyi district, a few minutes’ walk away from Taipei 101, surrounded by dozens of cafes and restaurants, and my favourite night market in the city: Tonghua! This is one of my favourite Airbnb apartments I’ve stayed in so far.;;;;;;;;;

I’ll be spending the second half of the month doing all of the things that make me happy: cafe hopping my way around the city, stuffing my face with avocado toast, stocking up on Vegemite, and taking rock climbing lessons.;;;;;;;;;
Yes, really.;;;;;;;;;

Before I arrived, I had no idea what to expect from this little-visited Southern African spot and if I’m being honest, I was filled with trepidation. I had zero experience travelling Sub-Saharan Africa and the prospect of taking my first steps into the region (and doing so alone) was intimidating.;;;;;;;;;
Especially because when I started researching travel in Mozambique online, I quickly realised just how few travel bloggers have been to Mozambique, how few trip reports there are, and how, if you venture into forums, you’ll find dozens of people announcing how unsafe it is and how, under no circumstances, should any woman travel there alone.;;;;;;;;;
So I packed my bags and went anyway, because one of my favourite things to do when I travel is to shatter perceptions of a place.;;;;;;;;;
And Mozambique? It’s perfectly safe for women travelling alone. It’s beautiful. It’s exciting. It’s adventurous. It makes you feel alive. The locals are so welcoming. The food is delicious. The beaches are out of this world.;;;;;;;;;
The travel may be tougher here, but the rewards are far greater.;;;;;;;;;
I tiptoed into Mozambique, wondering whether I’d be fleeing to South Africa in just a few days, but instead had to drag myself out of the country several weeks later. I can’t wait to return.;;;;;;;;;
This is what it’s like to travel in Mozambique.;;;;;;;;;
A sandy street in the backpacker hangout of Tofo. Wander around here in the mornings, when everyone is sleeping off their hangovers, and you’ll barely see another person!;;;;;;;;;
Don’t Believe Everything You Read;;;;;;;;;
Confession: I was terrified when I arrived in Maputo.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t that I had no idea what to expect, but that I had read so many scary pieces online that I was expecting nothing but danger. Let’s a take a look at some of the quotes I stumbled upon, from articles, blog posts and comments in forums:;;;;;;;;;
Criminals are forceful and ruthless, often work in groups, and carry firearms. Expats and tourists have been targeted in the past, so be sure not to display any signs of wealth: jewelry, running shoes, cameras and purses should be left in the hotel or hidden extremely well.;;;;;;;;;
Women should never walk alone on the beach or take the bus unaccompanied. Unfortunately, attacks on female tourists have been increasing.;;;;;;;;;
Parents, DO NOT let your children travel to Mozambique!;;;;;;;;;
I had a very rough start. Within hours of my arrival in Chimoio I was cheated by moneychangers, had my laptop stolen in a hostel, had to abandon a horrid bus where we were squashed like sardines with stereo blasting. To top things off I was unable to get cash since ATMs very randomly accept cards in Mozambique.;;;;;;;;;
I wouldn’t recommend it. I did it a few years ago with my then Girlfriend. In the capital Maputo the hostel had guards on the gate to make sure no-one broke in. Armed guards at the ATM too.;;;;;;;;;
Does that sound like a safe and wonderful country you’d want to visit?;;;;;;;;;
Yeah, me neither.;;;;;;;;;
So, why did I go? Because I love getting to show the reality of misunderstood places around the world. And in amongst the horror stories I found online, there were gushing reports of life-changing trips in a beautiful country full of welcoming locals.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So I went, and you know what? I felt just as safe in Mozambique as I do in many places in the world. I wandered on the beaches on my own and only ran into locals who wanted to make friends and show me around. I carried my camera and my phone in a bag and took photos and wasn’t mugged. It’s all anecdotal, sure, but I didn’t feel like I was travelling in some kind of dangerous, lawless country. I felt safe and welcomed in Mozambique — it felt no different to wandering around in Southeast Asia, for example.;;;;;;;;;
I learned a valuable lesson here, in not believing everything you read about a place, and the importance of checking it out with your own eyes before making a judgment. Don’t let the fear-mongering online put you off visiting Mozambique — I felt less safe in South Africa, which is a place most people wouldn’t have any qualms about visiting.;;;;;;;;;
If you are nervous about travelling to Mozambique, make sure you’re reading reports and experiences from people who have actually been to the country. It’s too easy for people to leave horrible comments on articles online, speaking about how Mozambique is dangerous, when they haven’t even been themselves.;;;;;;;;;

The Visa is Awful to Get if You Won’t Be Travelling Overland;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never written a guide for applying for a visa on this site before, but I’m in the process of finishing up one for Mozambique. Why? Because the entire process was complicated, frustrating, and wholly unclear. It was so bad that I started my application process over a month before my departure date and had my visa approved the day before I left. Man, that was nerve-wracking!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In a typical example of African bureaucracy, you can easily apply for a visa when traveling overland from South Africa. But when you’re flying in, the official stance is that you need to apply for a visa in advance. And to get said visa, you need to have absolutely everything booked in advance and your confirmations printed out, as well as a whole host of other documents and information. I even had to show a photocopy of my residency certificate for Portugal!;;;;;;;;;
The most frustrating aspect of the entire process is that there’s no clarity surrounding the procedure. Some people claim you don’t need to worry and can get a visa on arrival; some say they were turned away at the airport. Some people say you just need to fill out a form; others needed to have bank statement, flight bookings, hotel bookings, letters of invitation, proof of residency. Some people have been told completely different things by two people at the same embassy.;;;;;;;
If you’re heading to Mozambique, allow yourself plenty of time to get the visa and prepare for multiple trips to the embassy.;;;;;;;;;
Update: you can now get a visa on arrival! Ignore everything I just wrote :-);;;;;;;;;
This was the view I woke up to every morning in Vilanculos: sandbanks for dayyyyys!;;;;;;;;;
Mozambique is Bigger Than You Think;;;;;;;;;
I gave myself two weeks to explore Mozambique and believed that would be enough time to jump my way along its coastline.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yeah. Mozambique is so much bigger than it looks on maps! The coastline, for example, is more than 1500 miles long, which is roughly the same length as the east coast of the U.S.;;;;;;;;;
Would you give yourself two weeks to travel the entire east coast of the U.S.? Nope! ;;;;;;;;;
That’s a whole lot of land to cover and if you’ll be doing it overland, you can expect to spend days travelling from the south to the north. If you’re hoping to fly, you’ll be at the mercy of LAM, the Mozambican airline. Flights are infrequent and illogical, rarely going from where you are to where you want to be, and especially not on the date you want to fly.;;;;;;;;;
When you’re in Mozambique, less is more. Build travel delays into your schedule and aim to spend three-to-five days in each place rather than one or two. I decided to spend my two weeks exploring the south of Mozambique and will save exploring the north for my next visit. The south is the more touristed part of the country, but the north still has a lot to offer — I can’t wait to finally get there.;;;;;;;;;
If you have a month, you can comfortably see the vast majority of the country’s major tourist attractions. Here’s a quick breakdown of the routes you could follow:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Two weeks in the south: Maputo, Tofo, and Vilanculos/Bazaruto Archipelago;;;;;;;;;
Two weeks in the north: Nampula, Ilha de Mocambique, Pemba, Quirimbas Islands;;;;;;;;;
One month: these two itineraries combined! Maybe with a trip to Gorongosa National Park in between.;;;;;;;;;

Traveling in Mozambique Can Feel Adventurous;;;;;;;;;
I was surprised when I touched down in Mozambique and discovered that hardly anyone travels alone in this country. The travellers I met were shocked that I was brave enough to visit solo — and I certainly didn’t feel brave! People would tell me that I was courageous and adventurous, and I’d be there having no idea that me going to Mozambique alone was a Big Deal.;;;;;;;;;
And while I felt safe in Mozambique, there’s no denying that this was some of the most hardcore travel I’ve encountered to date.;;;;;;;;;
It was having to be super-careful with my DSLR and keeping it hidden away, sometimes only snapping photos when nobody was around or tons of people were surrounding me.;;;;;;;;;
It was learning that it wasn’t safe to walk anywhere at night and having to take taxis in the evenings.;;;;;;;;;
It was the public chapas — minivan buses that squeeze ten times the capacity into one sweaty, humid box while you bounce over potholed roads for hours at a time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
It was not being able to trust the police, because they’re corrupt as hell and always looking for a way to extort money from you.;;;;;;;;;
It was the ATMs running out of money or not accepting my card.;;;;;;;;;
It was having to be fearful of malaria and waking up to enormous bugs in my room, no matter how much money I paid for my stay.;;;;;;;;;
It was the security guards outside of hostels and hotels and banks and stores.;;;;;;;;;
In Mozambique, things felt rougher around the edges. The travel was more difficult and less comfortable, but was so worth it.;;;;;;;;;
It’s definitely not a destination for first-time travellers, though.;;;;;;;;;
Living that digital nomad dream (looking at a beach but being chained to your laptop and unable to enjoy it);;;;;;;;;
TAAG is a Good Way to Get There for Cheap;;;;;;;;;
I scored some bargain flights from Angolan airline TAAG, which made it super-affordable to visit Mozambique from Europe. I highly recommend keeping an eye on their flight prices and making note of when they’ll be having any sales. At around $250 return from Lisbon, Mozambique was cheaper to fly to than many European destinations would have been!;;;;;;;;;

Tofo Beach from above. If you visit in low season, you’ll basically have the entire beach to yourself all day!;;;;;;;;;
Low Season is Slow Season;;;;;;;;;
I was concerned about visiting Mozambique in January, the wettest month of the year, but guess how much rain I experienced? One afternoon in Maputo that lasted for an hour, and an overnight thunderstorm in Tofo. That was it! Just as in Southeast Asia, I learned that the rainy season isn’t actually a terrible time to visit: the prices are cheaper, there are fewer tourists, and the rain isn’t frequent enough to spoil your vacation.;;;;;;;;;
The rainy season definitely puts off many travellers from visiting Mozambique, though. In Maputo, I wandered around for six hours and didn’t see a single tourist. In Tofo, I would head down to the huge beach each afternoon and find myself sharing it with maybe three other people. When eating at restaurants in Vilanculos, my group of friends and I would often be the only people eating in the restaurant.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It sounds kind of boring, but it was actually fascinating. Imagine going to somewhere like Koh Phi Phi and having the entire place to yourself. In Mozambique, it’s possible!;;;;;;;;;
If you’re aiming to visit Mozambique in the rainy season, be sure to keep an eye on the weather reports before you visit, and ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance that covers natural disasters and cancelled trips. I use and recommend World Nomads for trips to Mozambique, as they cover you in these situations.;;;;;;;;;
Tofo Beach, which, fun fact, is actually pronounced as tofu.;;;;;;;;;
Take Your Anti-Malarials;;;;;;;;;
I’d never taken anti-malarial tablets until I went to Mozambique, for the simple reason that none of the countries I was visiting were deemed high-risk, and dengue was more of a problem in them, for which there is no prophylaxis. Given how much time I’ve spent in mosquito danger zones, I’d have most likely ended up taking anti-malarials for years at a time, which wouldn’t have been great for my liver. So, whenever I was in the tropics, I would make sure to use bug spray, cover up, and attempt to avoid getting bitten as much as possible.;;;;;;;;;
Well, Mozambique is high-high-high risk for malaria. Like, it’s one of the top five countries affected by malaria, with its prevalence ranging from 46% for children in rural areas to 17% in the cities. 26% of hospital deaths in Mozambique are due to malaria and every single local and expat I spoke to had contracted it a dozen times or more. And when I was researching early malaria symptoms, a significant amount of the people commenting in forums had contracted it in Mozambique.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The risk of malaria is real in Mozambique and you can die from it. Anyone who says anti-malarials are worse than malaria itself has never had cerebral malaria, which is a complication of a specific malaria parasite that is most prevalent in Mozambique. Cerebral malaria causes your brain to swell, which can lead to permanent brain damage, and also causes liver failure, kidney failure, rupturing of the spleen, fluid in the lungs, and death.;;;;;;;;;
Take anti-malarials! ;;;;;;;;;
Malarone and doxycycline are both effective in Mozambique and I’ve never experienced major side effects with either.;;;;;;;;;
It’s One of the Best Places to Dive on the Planet;;;;;;;;;
Mozambique is all about the megafauna, with tons of whale sharks and manta rays visiting Tofo year round, and dugongs popping up every now and then near Vilanculos. I even got to swim with humpback dolphins on an ocean safari on Tofo!;;;;;;;;;
Let’s be honest: I’m not a diver, so I can’t speak from personal experience, but the vast majority of visitors to Tofo are there for the diving, and everyone I met couldn’t stop gushing about how mind-blowing it was.;;;;;;;;;
For me, I settled with some snorkelling in both Tofo and Vilanculos, and the latter was some of the best of my life. I got to swim with an octopus, trumpetfish, parrotfish, stonefish, and a bunch of other colourful fish that I couldn’t identify but ogled at nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;
Welcome to Maputo!;;;;;;;;;
Maputo Isn’t Going to Be the Highlight of Your Trip;;;;;;;;;
Oh man, I really didn’t like Maputo.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I hate saying that I hated a place, but I really hated Maputo.;;;;;;;;;
I gave myself three days in the capital city, something that drew nothing but winces from fellow travellers when I shared this fact. Quite frankly, it was two days too long, as the vast majority of tourist sites can be seen during a day of wandering.;;;;;;;;;
I’d hoped to go to the Maputo Elephant Reserve, but no tour companies would take solo travellers unless I paid double, which would work out to be around $400. I wanted to take a walking tour of the city, but the tour guide didn’t reply to my email enquiry until after I’d left Maputo.;;;;;;;;;
So, that was fine. I told myself I’d just wander around the city and try to find its heart in amongst the trash. Guys, I’ve spent a lot of time in developing countries and trash doesn’t even bother me — it’s something I rarely notice — but in Maputo it. was. everywhere. On every single street I walked down, even the most popular ones in the centre of the city, it was piled up everywhere.;;;;;;;;;
The harassment was real and intimidating. Men would drive their cars alongside me, calling me baby, then pull over, get out of the car, and follow me down the road! Practically every single man I passed on the street would call me sister or mama or baby or click his tongue or hiss at me. My guidebook said that walking along the red light distract during the day was safe and interesting, but it resulted in nothing a bunch of prostitutes shouting at me.;;;;;;;;;
The most touristy things to do in the city weren’t even that wonderful, which made the sightseeing boring. Basically, I ended up feeling like there was nothing of interest to see, the harassment was intimidating, and I spent most of the time hiding and recovering in my room.;;;;;;;;;

If you go to Mozambique, aim to spend no more than a day in Maputo. The best parts of the country are elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;
Beach in Vilanculos at low tide.;;;;;;;;;
The Beaches are Spectacular;;;;;;;;;
Mozambique has some of the best beaches in the world, and the absolute best thing about them is that on most of them, you’ll have them all to yourself!;;;;;;;;;
My favourite beaches were in Vilanculos and the Bazaruto Archipelago. This part of Mozambique is all about the sandbanks, and at low tide, you can walk out across them for hours if you wanted. It’s like being on another planet.;;;;;;;;;

You Can Get By Without Speaking Portuguese;;;;;;;;;
I was concerned about my lack of Portuguese language skills beyond the basic Portuguese I use while living in Lisbon, but I needn’t have worried. I encountered zero language barriers within the country and 95% of the people I ran into spoke great English.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Chapas Will Make You Cry Sweat, But There are Alternatives;;;;;;;;;
Imagine a humid minivan with terrible suspension, bumping its way along pot-holed roads on a thirty degree day. Now imagine filling it with 10 times more people than the recommended capacity, until you’re all packed in the back like sweaty sardines. Maybe throw a child on your lap and some smelly food in there, too. Now, get the driver to rip you off on the price and have the local men start calling you baby and asking if you can take them back home with you.;;;;;;;;;

That’s a chapa and it’s the easiest way to get around the country. They are also awful, so don’t be surprised if after your first ride, you swear off them and opt for flights and private transfers to get around.;;;;;;;;;
Which is exactly what I did.;;;;;;;;;
Catching the sunrise on my final morning in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
It’s Pretty Affordable;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t sure what to expect for affordability in Mozambique, as Africa isn’t the most inexpensive of continents, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation is where most of your money will go in Mozambique, unless you’re cool with dorm rooms. For a basic room in a guesthouse in Maputo, I paid $32 a night, for a fancy resort stay in Tofo that was one of the best places I’ve ever stayed in, I paid $63 a night, and for a private room in a backpacker hostel in Vilanculos, I paid $28 a night, although they had dorms there for as little as $9 a night.;;;;;;;;;
Transportation varies depending on your level of comfort. If you wanted to travel between Tofo and Vilanculos, you could pay $3.50 to take several chapas and a ferry, $100 to hire a private driver to take you there, or $80 to fly there. Some people opt to hitchhike in Mozambique without a problem, but I didn’t try it while I was there.;;;;;;;;;
And food is cheap, cheap, cheap! You can expect to pay around $2-3 a meal, or $10 if you’re in a fancy, sit-down restaurant for tourists. A beer is a couple of dollars.;;;;;;;;;
Activities can be pretty pricey, depending on where you book them and how many people you’re traveling with. I had to turn down a lot of activities I was excited for because as a lone traveller, I was told I’d have to pay double to take any tours. It’s therefore best to stay in hostels and take their tours if you’re travelling alone. For a snorkelling ocean safari in Tofo, I paid $35, and for a day in the Bazaruto Archipelago, I paid $50.;;;;;;;;;
It’s Safe for Solo Women Travellers;;;;;;;;;
I really wasn’t sure what the demographics of travellers to Mozambique would be, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a mix of ages, travel styles, and races. And while I was one of the very few solo female travellers in the country, it was easy to make friends and I felt as safe as I do in Southeast Asia (very). I will say that I felt least safe in Maputo, even though nothing bad happened to me there, but the levels of harassment were intense.;;;;;;;;;
What you can expect as a solo traveller in Mozambique, especially if you’re white like me, and especially especially if you’re blonde, is a lot of attention. For the most part, though, it’s totally harmless, and most dudes just want to chat and flirt with you.;;;;;;;;;

You’ll Still Want to Get Good Travel Insurance;;;;;;;;;
All I can offer is anecdotes, but even with my fantastic experiences, Mozambique is still more of a hardcore travel destination and there are horror stories online.;;;;;;;;;
For the first time since starting travelling, I shelled out for the most expensive travel insurance option with World Nomads that I could buy. I also, for the first time ever, paid to cover some personal items, as I was going to be travelling with both my Macbook Pro and Sony A7ii camera, and didn’t want to have to pay to replace them. For most travellers, the worst that will happen in Mozambique is that they’ll be robbed, so I do recommend covering your personal items with travel insurance if you’re going to be travelling with a lot of technology.;;;;;;;;;
Mozambique: One of My New Favourite Countries!;;;;;;;;;
I love, love, loved my time in Mozambique and I’m already planning my return trip.;;;;;;;;;
The beaches are wonderful, the locals are friendly, the food is delicious, and did I mention the beaches? It’s worth going to Mozambique just for them.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yes, after ten years of travel, and 90 countries, I’m calling it: the Cook Islands is the most beautiful place on the planet. And yes, that’s including the Maldives and Bora Bora — Aitutaki blows them both out of the water! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The entirety of this island nation is stunning. Rarotonga and Aitutaki are breathtaking, ringed by turquoise lagoons and swaying palm trees, encouraging you to do little but relax. Lagoon cruises take you out into perfection, where you’ll swim with fish, have lunch on a deserted island, and take so many photos that you’ll be in danger of running out of storage on your phone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Not only is the Cook Islands beautiful, but it’s easy to travel around, too. The locals are ridiculously friendly and welcoming, and the local dishes are delicious. In short, there’s no reason not to travel to the Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But in case you needed another one: it’s really easy to visit on a budget.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how to do it. ;;;;;;;;;

How to Find Cheap Flights to the Cook Islands;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I write this right now, my post is aimed solely at those of you who are lucky enough to be in New Zealand. And what that means is that your options for cheaper flights are going to be pretty limited — only Air New Zealand are flying to the Cook Islands right now, so prices aren’t all that competitive. After all, there’s no competition!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Still, I recommend heading to Skyscanner and search for all flights over the space of a month, rather than choosing a specific date (if you have that flexibility, of course). Oon average you’ll be looking at around $400 (that’s NZD) for a one-way ticket in August 2021 — $800 return, with the prices dropping to around $350 each way from September onwards. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

How Long to Spend in the Cook Islands?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When you’re booking those flights to paradise, you’re probably wondering when you should be looking to return to New Zealand. I recommend spending seven to 10 nights in the Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent a week there — three days on Rarotonga; four on Aitutaki — and found it to be the perfect amount of time. In actuality, I would have done my split a little differently and had four days on Rarotonga with three on Aitutaki, simply because the latter is pretty small. Once you’ve seen the lagoon on Aitutaki, there isn’t that much else to do, so you could get bored. ;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you had 10 days in the Cook Islands, you’d probably want to go with six days on Rarotonga and four on Aitutaki.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And if you’re planning on spending two weeks in the Cook Islands, I’d recommend taking a look at some of the more isolated islands, like Atiu — I’m going to be checking that one out later this year. It’s expensive to fly to from Rarotonga, as so few people visit, but that’s what draws me to it. I love visiting isolated pockets in the South Pacific that see little tourism. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is paradise!;;;;;;;;;

You Can Save Money By Visiting During Low Season;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tourism in the Cook Islands is unsurprisingly pretty seasonal, so if you’re looking to save money, visiting in the rainy season can help you save money. It’s worth mentioning that you run the risk of flying straight into a cyclone when you do so, but those are quite rare, so you’d have to be seriously unlucky for your trip to coincide with one. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I last visited the Cook Islands in January and lucked out when I experienced zero days of rain. Obviously that doesn’t guarantee you’ll also have a dry vacation, but if you’re willing to take the risk, you may find yourself with accommodation at half the price while the weather is nothing but glorious.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My top tip: Plan to Spend Your Trip as Offline as Possible;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Free Wi-Fi is challenging to find in the Cook Islands, even in 2021, so I recommend planning to spend the vast majority of your time in the country offline. In a place this beautiful, it’s not much of a hardship to do so. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you have to be online, you’ll need to opt for buying Wi-Fi vouchers from the overpriced Zenbu or Bluesky — the latter is cheaper and charges $25 for 1.5GB of data. Most of the hotels, restaurants, and cafes on the island use one of these two providers to connect to the Wi-Fi, and most of the connections are, um, usable. Speeds are improving but this isn’t a destination in which to catch up with your favourite Youtubers.;;;;;;;;;

You can also pick up a local SIM card at the airport for $49, which gives you 3 GB of data for 14 days. I’d definitely recommend doing this.;;;;;;;;;

Visiting Rarotonga on a Budget;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was surprised by how easy it is to visit Rarotonga on a budget. Hostels exist, public buses are cheap, you can find street food, and tours aren’t crazy-expensive. You don’t have to work all that hard to save money.;;;;;;;;;

How to Save on Accommodation in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Let’s take a look at a map of Rarotonga.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you want to visit Rarotonga on as tight a budget as possible, your best option is to stay in a hostel: I was thrilled to discover that there are several on the island! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are three main areas for accommodation on Rarotonga. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aroa Beach, in the Arorangi District that I mentioned above. This is where you’ll find the cheap accommodation and hostels. There isn’t a huge amount to do in this specific part of the island, besides lounge on the sand, but it’s still beautiful, there are restaurants around, and you can easily take the bus to the main town of Avarua or spectacular Muri Beach. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are two hostels in Arorangi: ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I stayed at Rarotonga Backpackers, which cost $28/night for a dorm bed and $40 for a private single room ($55 for a private double). It’s not just me that loves it here, either — it gets a rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google. The staff were so wonderful and friendly, it was easy to meet people and make friends — even as a solo traveller — and there was a lovely swimming pool, barbecue area, and a gorgeous beach beside the adorable huts. I thought it was great value for money! They aren’t listed on any of the booking sites, so you’ll need to fill in a request through their contact form. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As an alternative, Backpackers International is by far the cheapest hostel on the island, with dorms coming in at $20 a night and private rooms at $35/night for a double. I haven’t personally stayed here, and they receive worse reviews than Rarotonga Backpackers, so I’d only consider staying here if you’re on a very tight budget. Otherwise Rarotonga Backpackers is the way to go! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The other area you might want to consider staying in is Avarua, in the north, which is the capital of the island and has tons to see and do. This is the area to opt for if you’re not a fan of lying on the beach and doing nothing. If you love museums and culture and enjoy having a wide variety of restaurants to choose from, this is the spot for you. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ve got one main option for affordable accommodation here: ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Central Motel: This is the cheapest option in Avarua, coming in at $125 a night. While the sound of staying in a motel might put you off, it’s a motel with a swimming pool and a lovely owner, so it’s got plenty to offer up. The property is in a great location, close to a supermarket, restaurants, and the airport, with air conditioning and hot water showers. This would be a great budget option if you’re flying out the next day and want to stay close to the airport the night before. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And finally, the third region of the island that you should consider staying in is Muri Beach, in the southeast, which is the most popular part of Rarotonga. And for good reason: it has the prettiest beach on the island! It’s a breathtaking part of Rarotonga, so if you’re keen for that pristine beach holiday, this is the area to look at. The only downside? It’s where all of the expensive resorts are! For that reason, it can be a little pricey. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I stayed at Raina Beach Apartments in Muri for my second visit to Rarotonga. It was much pricer at almost $120 a night, but Muri is the most expensive area in Rarotonga. My apartment was spacious, with a large balcony overlooking the lagoon, a fully-equipped kitchen, and plenty of space to work from, so it didn’t feel like I was being ripped off. It was in a great location, had great staff, and plenty of cheap eats nearby: it was perfect! If I’d been travelling with somebody else to split the costs with, I’d have happily stayed here the entire time. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I next return to Rarotonga, though, I plan on staying in Aremango Guesthouse, which is also in Muri. At $46 a night for a solo traveller and $53 a night for a double room, it’s the cheapest guesthouse in expensive Muri. Not only that, it also receives great reviews for pretty much everything.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tropical Sands is another great option for Muri Beach. Well, it’s a five minute drive, or 30 minute walk, from beautiful Muri Beach, which is why it’s $150 a night and not double that. But it receives exceptional reviews and is easily one of the best value, nicest properties on the island. If it’s within your budget, I would book here over everywhere else mentioned in the article. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And a final note here: annoyingly, half of the accommodation in Rarotonga requires you to stay for a minimum of three nights. This isn’t awful, as Rarotonga is beautiful and well worth exploring, but if your plan was to fly into Rarotonga, spend a night, and then head to Aitutaki, you won’t have as many options for accommodation. If you’re searching for hotels and struggling to find any, adjust your search to three nights and whole bunch of other places will pop up for you to book. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Let’s move on to transportation. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A view of Rarotonga’s airport from the road: it was so jungly!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting Around Rarotonga on a Budget;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As you can tell from the Google Maps screenshot above, Rarotonga only has one major road; a loop that traces the coastline for 20 miles, so walking everywhere isn’t a realistic possibility. Taxis are expensive, too, and there are only a couple on the island; I didn’t see a single one while I was there.;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The cheapest way to explore Rarotonga, then, is by bus. There are three buses in the entire country[!], and in Rarotonga, one of them runs clockwise and the other anti-clockwise. A single ticket costs $5 or you can buy a full hop-on, hop-off day pass for $16. You can view the 2021 schedule here, but in general: the bus runs every hour both clockwise and anticlockwise for much of the day — excluding Sundays, when it doesn’t run at all — so you’ll never have to wait too long for one to swing by.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I also recommend taking the bus over the airport transfers offered by the hostels and guesthouses to save $10-25 each way. Most accommodation providers don’t offer up a free airport transfer, so if you’re not in a rush to get to your room, it’s worth waiting around for the bus instead.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cook Islands is famous for their motorbike driving licenses, which make for a particularly fun souvenir. A 10-minute driving test and $20 ($10 for the theory test; $10 for the practical) is all it takes to get yours, and this then allows you to hire scooters and ride around the islands. All you need to do is turn up to the police station in Avarua. There, you’ll show your passport, fill in a short piece of paperwork, pay your fee, then get down to action. Answer a simple quiz full of easy, common-sense questions, then drive up and down a short alleyway, showing you can weave through some cones and indicate when turning. You’ll then have your driving license!;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It costs around $15 a day to rent a scooter, or $7 for a bicycle. On an island that’s so quiet, you don’t have to worry about traffic and accidents — this is a place where everyone goes slow.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Car hire is expensive, so if you’re thinking about doing this, I’d instead recommend looking at some of the island tours on offer through Viator. They have lots of options for exploring the island with a guide, whether it’s on bicycles, minivan, or tuk-tuk, and they’re all around $40-50 to do so. I book all of my tours through Viator.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
How to Save money on Food in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s far easier to eat on a budget in Rarotonga than it is in Aitutaki, thanks to the street food carts and night markets you can find dotted around the island. Look for small shacks selling fish sandwiches by the side of the road for the best bargains, and if there’s a queue of locals outside, it’s a sign it’ll be delicious.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you spend any time in Avarua, the row of shacks pictured above is the place to be for enormous seafood platters for $7-10. They’re located alongside the lagoon close to the market and have tons of options.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In Muri, The Mooring Cafe is always full of locals and super-popular for lunch. The fish sandwiches ($8.50) are so delicious that I ate there everyday. Muri’s night market is your best option for cheap dinners, offering generous portions of local dishes and live music on most evenings. I highly recommend checking it out for both a cultural experience and to save money.;;;;;;;;;

What to Do While You’re in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re on a strict budget and don’t want to spend much money on activities, there’s plenty to keep you busy on the island for free. Sunbathing on the beach is, of course, what most people come to the Cook Islands for and most guesthouses will have snorkels you can use out in the lagoon, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The centre of Rarotonga is all about the mountains, giving you tons of options to hike up to viewpoints all over the island. While you should hire a guide if you want to walk across the centre of the island — you can do this through your accommodation — it’s not necessary if you just want to get up high. Some of the easier (2-3 hour round trip) hikes are the Wigmore Falls track, the Avana Valley track, and the Raemaru track.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of the best ways to explore the Cook Islands is by water, and a lagoon cruise in Muri is the way to go. Captain Tamas runs tours of the lagoon ($54) and is the highest rated tour company on the island. If you only do one activity while you’re in Rarotonga, this is the one to splurge on.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you want to see as much of Rarotonga as possible, but feel nervous about navigating yourself, there are tours of the island that you can sign up for, as I mentioned above. The most affordable of these is a 3-hour minivan trip ($44), but there’s also a 4-hour cycling tour ($51) that sounds super-fun, and even the opportunity to explore the island via a tuk-tuk tour ($54)!;;;;;;;;;

How to Get From Rarotonga to Aitutaki and Back;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s only one way to get from Rarotonga to Aitutaki and that’s to fly with Air Rarotonga. Unfortunately, their prices are ridiculous and there are currently no ferries.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The best advice I can give is to book as early as possible, as soon as you buy your flights to the Cook Islands. I booked my flights less than two weeks before arriving and ended up paying $200 each way. For a thirty. minute. flight. A quick look at Air Rarotonga’s website shows the prices drop the further out you book, with flights in a few months’ time coming in at $120 each way. Still pretty expensive, but more affordable than a $400 round-trip that I had to pay for!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The other alternative is to just turn up in Rarotonga, head to the Air Rarotonga office and book through them. There are reports of people getting fares for half the price by booking last-minute, but you do run the risk of there being no availability on any of the flights. Or the flights being really expensive.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And you really do need to head to Aitutaki. If you only visit Rarotonga, you’ll be missing out on what makes the Cook Islands so special. ;;;;;;;;;

How to Visit Aitutaki on a Budget;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is paradise and paradise doesn’t come cheap. From my initial research, I could immediately tell that this was going to be a splurge destination, but once I arrived, it actually wasn’t too bad at all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Budget Accommodation Options on Aitutaki;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There aren’t any hostels in Aitutaki, but there are a few affordable guesthouses. I stayed in a few different spots around the island and my favourite was Gina’s Garden Lodges. For $60 a night, I had an enormous bungalow with five beds — a bargain if you’re travelling with a group of friends! Gina was the loveliest human with a fascinating life, and she even gave me a huge hug when she drove me back to the airport. The bungalows were peaceful and surrounded by jungle, which made them particularly cool in my mind.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Another affordable option is Ranganui’s Retreat at $100 a night. I also stayed here, but didn’t like it all that much. The lack of air conditioning meant that my room was like a furnace, and the owner was never around whenever I needed to ask a question or buy a new internet voucher. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But overall, I believe the best place to stay on Aitutaki is the exceptional Aitutaki Budget Accommodation at a price of $70 a night — it receives a rating of 9.7/10 on Booking! Staying here will give you a true local experience, staying with a welcoming family and being accepted into their home. Guests write of the owners cooking dinners for them, inviting them on nights out with their friends, and repairing clothes that got torn. How could you not want to stay here?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Beach on Aitutaki;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting Around Aitutaki;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is much smaller than Rarotonga and you can easily explore the entire island in half a day. Bicycle rentals are either free to use from your guesthouse (although likely to be awful — my hands were sore for days afterwards), or around $5 a day. Scooters are $25/day. There aren’t any buses or taxis on the island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ll need to organise an airport transfer with your accommodation, which will come to around $10-20 each way depending on how far you’re staying from the airport.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What Can You Do in Aitutaki?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The one thing I recommend that everyone do in Aitutaki is take a cruise of the lagoon — it was one of the highlights of my five years of travel! I went with Teking Tours and was thrilled with my experience. They’re one of the more affordable options on the island, with a full day cruise coming in at $70.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Other than that, know that Aitutaki is small and if you plan to spend more than three or four days there, you’re likely to get bored. You can traverse the island within a couple of hours by bicycle, hike up to one of the viewpoints (my favourite was Piraki Lookout, but Maunga Pu was great, too), or sunbathe on the beach (and I actually found the beaches to be better on Rarotonga).;;;;;;;;;

How to Save on Food;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re planning on saving money by cooking, expect to live off of crap food. In Aitutaki, especially, where cargo arrives only once every three months, it’s hard to find good eats as a tourist. In grocery stores, expect to find rows of tinned food and bags of chips and candy, and no vegetables or fresh meat/fish. If you want fresh food, you’ll either have to befriend a local or find out when the market runs and hit it up in the early hours of the day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to eating out, lunches will set you back around $15 a meal and dinners $20. An easy way to cut down on costs is to eat vegetarian, which I did for much of my time there. In most restaurants on Aitutaki, the vegetarian options were only around $10.;;;;;;;;;

Paradise Isn’t as Expensive as You Think;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
"Before I came to the Cook Islands, I was under the impression that somewhere so isolated and beautiful would only be for the rich. But just like in the Maldives, I was thrilled to discover that budget travel is a real possibility. Stay in hostels, eat street food, rent bicycles, and there’s no reason why you can’t average around $50 a day while you’re there.""";;;;;;;;;

They ranged from visiting Bora Bora on a budget (check!) to visiting my big European oversights (check!) to starting to take more defined trips (check!)";;;;;;;;;
Those were all fairly easy to tick off my list, but I’ve been struggling with one particular goal for a while now: to take a trip I never would have considered before. As I wrote in my post:;;;;;;;;;
I want to get out of my comfort zone this year and try something I would normally steer away from. It could be anything from a yoga retreat to a surf instructor course; a spa holiday in a 5* resort to a camping trip. I think it’ll be fun to try something that’s not me at all and see how much I enjoy/hate it.;;;;;;;;
I pondered it for months until it finally hit me. The perfect way for me to smash this goal would be to splash out and take one of the most luxurious trips I could possibly imagine. I was going to be travelling alone around Europe, which would be the best opportunity for me to do it.;;;;;;;;;
Because every single time I’ve travelled solo, I’ve done it on the tightest budget possible. I stay in cheap dorm rooms, I walk everywhere, I eat inexpensively, I end up dealing with creepy hostel owners, getting bedbugs, and having people throw up in my room two days in a row.;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve been reading my site for any amount of time, you’ll know that my biggest travel splurges have been for the people I love most in my life. I’ll think nothing of splashing out several hundreds — or sometimes even several thousands — of dollars on helping my favourite people celebrate their special occasions in beautiful places around the world. It’s one of my favourite things to do.;;;;;;;;;
…So why don’t I ever do it for myself?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That was a tough question for me to face. Why don’t I see myself as worthy? Why do I give so much to the people I love, but leave nothing for me? Ack.;;;;;;;;;

It’s been a tough few years for me — you guys know that. So many panic attacks and illnesses and events that have sent my self-esteem down the drain and into the sewers.;;;;;;;;;
But now that my anxiety is finally under control (I’m now three months anxiety free!), I can prioritise building myself back up.;;;;;;;;;
And Berlin was just the place to start.;;;;;;;;;
It would be a trip of firsts for me: my first taste of luxury travel as a solo traveler; my first massage after my traumatising experience in Bangkok (I’ve not had a massage since, and the hotel I chose to stay in has one of the best spas in the world, so I decided to take the plunge!); and my first time treating myself to a fancy AF meal (after spending my early solo travel days surviving on McDonald’s and supermarket food, I was going to eat at a two Michelin star restaurant.);;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
Staying at the Mandala Hotel;;;;;;;;;
I opted to stay at the Mandala Hotel, because I wanted to stay in a hotel that had a spa (for my massage challenge) and their ONO spa had amazing reviews. As did the hotel. It’s a five-star hotel in Potsdamer Platz, ranked 10th on TripAdvisor, and sounded incredible. It looked perfect for my challenge.;;;;;;;;;
And it was after making this decision, I wondered whether my Trip I Would Have Never Considered Taking Before could actually be me accepting a comped stay somewhere.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Because my five night stay in an executive suite at the Mandala came to just over $2,000.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
In the past, my experiences of luxury travel as a budget traveller haven’t been the greatest. I mean, I loved staying in an overwater bungalow in the Maldives, but it also felt like an enormous rip-off. I immediately decided that if I felt this way in Berlin, I wasn’t going to let it affect my trip: this was a treat for me and, as I kept reminding myself, I was worth it.;;;;;;;;;
Staying in a hotel this luxurious was a novelty for me: It was like having an entire house to myself! And there were all of these crazy features, like if you gave the staff a shopping list they’d go out and buy everything from a supermarket and bring it to your room for you. And they provided you a map of nearby jogging routes. There were five different types of pillows to choose from.;;;;;;;;;
There was a hotel doctor and dentist for guests. I had a walk-in closet the size of my childhood bedroom in London. I had a personal shopper in case I wanted to buy new clothes. They had personal trainers. They had this cool key system where whenever you put your key card in the slot for power, the staff could see you were in your room and wouldn’t disturb you.;;;;;;;;;
The gym was the fanciest I’ve ever been to, with fruit-infused water and ice cold face towels available everywhere. When reception called me a taxi when I was leaving, they walked me out to the street to make sure I found it okay! The list of amazing features was endless, although I didn’t have much use for many of them.;;;;;;;;;
Most importantly of all: when I rocked up looking like a backpacker, covered in sweat with frizzy hair, wearing ugly clothes and carrying a backpack, they were so welcoming to me! No judgment from anyone, while I was half-expecting they were going to ask me if I was lost.;;;;;;;;;
Overall, this was pretty much the most relaxed I’ve felt in a hotel ever. I loved every amazing second I spent at the Mandala.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My verdict: I have mixed feelings on this! The Mandala was undoubtably in my top five favourite places I’ve stayed in around the world, and I absolutely loved every moment I was there. It was probably the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The staff were amazing, my room was incredible, and, well, really, everything was perfect.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But it was so expensive. I struggled with justifying such a huge amount of money on something I basically have when I’m not on the move.;;;;;;;;;
So, would I do it again? Probably not to this extent.;;;;;;;;;
But it did show me how much more enjoyable and stress-free my solo travels could be and encouraged me to seek out nicer places to stay in the future. I don’t have to always opt for sleepless nights in dorm rooms and try to travel on as tight a budget as possible.;;;;;;;;;
And even though I did come to the conclusion that splurging on 5 star hotels around the world isn’t for me, it was an incredible experience that I’m glad I had. Just the first step towards showing myself more love in my life.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
Finally Facing Up to My Massage Fears;;;;;;;;;
The ONO spa is ranked the best in Berlin, and was also voted World’s Best Boutique Spa by Senses Wellness Guide (whatever that is…) — I knew I wanted a professional environment for dipping my toe back into the massage waters, and that definitely fit my criteria. It cost 100 euros for an hour-long massage.;;;;;;;;;
And god, was I anxious!;;;;;;;;;
When my masseuse asked me to remove all of my clothes, I panicked. Because after sharing what happened during my last massage, a load of people had reached out to tell me that my first sign something was wrong was me being told to take off all of my clothes — that you should never be told to be strip completely naked.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I’m cool with being naked and all that, but if I wasn’t supposed to remove all of my clothes, what should I do instead? But also, I was in Germany, where nakedness isn’t weird, so maybe I was supposed to take them all off. I couldn’t believe I was panicking already.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Funny story: when I was chatting to the masseuse before the massage, she asked if I was here for the marathon. At the time, I had no idea that the Berlin marathon was on during my stay, so I immediately assumed she was asking me if I was here to have a marathon massage. Which sounded like something I probably didn’t want — I didn’t have all day and a marathon massage sounded like it would take a long time.;;;;;;;;;
“Um, so what exactly is the marathon?” I asked.;;;;;;;;;
And then I had to stand and listen to her explain exactly what a marathon was to me. She must have thought I was so dumb!;;;;;;;;;
So, I had the massage and I felt a little out of my depth at first, because she asked me what kind of massage I liked and I had no idea beyond a non-intrusive one? And she asked about my favourite oils, and again, I had no idea. I definitely felt like a little kid who had no idea what they were even doing.;;;;;;;;;
But once that was out of the way and there were no awkward conversations, I was all good. And I was proud of myself for facing up to my fears!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My verdict: I’m actually surprised to say it probably wasn’t worth it for me. The massage was relaxing and it did feel indulgent, but honestly? I’ve felt more relaxed after 15 minutes in those massage chairs at airports. I was really expecting to feel amazing afterwards and was disappointed that I didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that could totally be because I was hyper-aware of everything that was going on to the point where I couldn’t fully allow myself to relax, but either way, I came away feeling that it was a nice experience, but it wasn’t 100 euros nice. When I went back down to my room afterwards, I felt normal.;;;;;;;;;
Would I have another massage in the future? I probably would! But it most likely wouldn’t be in a Western country with crazy-expensive prices. It just didn’t do enough for me for me to justify spending so much.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From Picky Eater to Fearful Solo Diner to Nothing But Confidence;;;;;;;;;
You all know the story. When I first started travelling, I was the pickiest eater ever. I hated foods with flavour. I hated anything I’d never tried before. I spent my first few months of travel surviving on McDonald’s and junk food from the supermarket. I was too afraid to try the local foods, because I assumed they would make me sick.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that sucked. What a miserable way to travel!;;;;;;;;;
Gradually, I worked up the courage to start trying new foods, and eventually my belief that every new flavour would send me into anaphylactic shock faded away. I started to realise the bland diet I’d kept to pre-travel had been incredibly boring. I kept trying more and more foods, each one exposing me to new flavours and textures, each one building up my confidence. And that continued until I reached the point where there’s literally nothing I can think of that I wouldn’t try eating now.;;;;;;;;;
The only barrier that remained was my fear of eating alone.;;;;;;;;;
I hated it.;;;;;;;;;
I avoided it whenever I could.;;;;;;;;;
I was so uncomfortable eating alone that sometimes, I’d just choose to not eat at all. When I travelled alone, I’d often revert back to eating supermarket food because it was easy to obtain, and I only really enjoyed what I ate when I was eating with somebody else and therefore didn’t have to be afraid of restaurants.;;;;;;;;;
I decided to make a change, and I feel like I should tell you here that it wasn’t easy, but it was. Super easy. I just started eating at restaurants. And at first, I was uncomfortable and awkward — I even spent five hours in a restaurant once because I was too nervous to ask for the bill.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But then I wasn’t so weird anymore. After a week of eating at restaurants for every meal, I was fine.;;;;;;;;;
And now eating alone is one of my favourite parts of solo travel. It’s a time to treat myself, read a book, people watch, and try some new foods. I’m no longer afraid of what people might be thinking of me. Especially because they’re most likely not thinking about me at all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Eating at Facil was all about proving how far I’ve come.;;;;;;;;;
I knew I would have truly defeated my eating alone demons if I could rock up to a two Michelin star restaurant in faded jeans and a top that’s seen the inside of 18 different washing machines around the world, confidently sit down, and enjoy my meal.;;;;;;;;;
And that’s exactly what I did.;;;;;;;;;
I was surrounded by stuffy businessmen in suits and rich-looking people, and yet I owned that lunch. I didn’t care.;;;;;;;;;
I even took a selfie.;;;;;;;;;
My verdict: 10/10; one of the best meals of my life; would totally do it again. ;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
I loved every second of my time in Berlin, and I’m so glad I decided to treat myself on this trip. While I came away thinking that I probably wouldn’t repeat such an experience to that level again, it was wonderful to have a taste of luxury in my life — even if it was for just five days.;;;;;;;;;

"This was one of my favourite trips ever!""";;;;;;;;;

And, confession time: it was during those dark days that I developed an obsession with Pinterest.";;;;;;;;;
I’d set myself a target to write/edit a thousand words and then allow myself a small escape to pin photos of the pretty places I’d visit once it was all over. It was through Pinterest that I discovered Ronda, one of the oldest cities in Spain, and conveniently, a three-hour train ride from Granada. What it’s most well known for, though, is its stunning cliffside location.;;;;;;;;;
And when I say cliffside, I mean cliffside.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yup.;;;;;;;;;
So when I handed in the first draft of my manuscript, I celebrated the momentous occasion the only way I know how: by booking a trip.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I packed my daypack and hit the rails with Dave, hoping that Ronda would bring me the rest and relaxation I’d been craving. I wanted to be outside. To wander down tiny alleyways and take photos of beautiful buildings, and not fall into El Tajo Gorge.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The moment I arrived, I felt like this was the Spain I’d been dreaming of, all white-washed buildings and rolling hills and orange trees and olive trees and signs advertising tapas outside of every bar.;;;;;;;;;
We started our explorations by picking a street at random and wandering down it. Five minutes later, we had reached the outskirts of the city and were making our way down a dirt track and into the countryside. I relished in the peacefulness and the sweet, unfamiliar sensation of fresh air on my face.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As we walked, I craned my neck behind me, grinning as I caught glimpses of Ronda, a mishmash of white buildings and red-tiled roofs crammed up against the cliffs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Despite it being March, it felt like an autumn day. The air was crisp, the branches of trees were stark, and the foliage a reddish-brown.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We returned to the city and passed through Plaza de España, the main square, which was full of Chinese tour groups and overpriced restaurants. Although we were firmly visiting in the low season, there were still a surprising amount of tourists around.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
By this point, I was itching to find those views of Ronda I’d spotted on Pinterest. We made our way over to Punte Nuevo Bridge, and from there, we had a spectacular sunset view of one of the most unusual places I’ve visited.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It doesn’t look too bad until you snap a portrait shot…;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Pretty incredible, huh? We must have stayed around the bridge for over an hour, snapping photos and watching the sunset, and all I could think about was how amazing this place was.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The following day, we awoke to incredible bright blue skies and a gale in the air. Given Ronda’s location — 750 metres above sea level and on top of a mountain — it wasn’t surprising to find ourselves being blown from one activity to the next.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our first stop was the Plaza de Toros, one of the oldest bullfighting rings in Spain. Maybe even the oldest, depending on who you choose to talk to. Bullfighting isn’t my thing, of course, but aside from one week every September, this one remains empty for tourists to wander around.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Inside, it was beautiful.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We also visited the bullfighting museum to learn more of the history and honestly, it was really boring. Dave found it interesting, though, and dragged me around for far too long.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Onwards!;;;;;;;;;
With sunny weather and a chill in the air, it felt like the perfect time to go for a walk. There are many, many hikes you can do outside of Ronda — or so we read. When we visited the tourist information shop, the woman there couldn’t tell us anything about them.;;;;;;;;;
With a shrug we walked out of town along a small path to see what we could find.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Amazing views, the answer would be. Check out that ridgeline!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As the path dropped down, hugging the side of the mountain, it gave us a spectacular view of the bridge from below.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Can you spot a small bridge at the bottom of the photo below? We walked to the that point and then an angry farmer chased us back up the hill because we were trespassing on his garden.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The following day, we decided to hike again, because while Ronda has to be one of the prettiest places I’ve visited, there wasn’t all that much to do there. We’d hit up all of the tourist spots we’d found recommended online, and spent hours wandering along narrow backstreets. I wanted to get down into the countryside and spend an entire day walking.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It made me nervous.;;;;;;;;;
I hadn’t walked more than around 20 steps a day for the past three months, so my fitness levels were at an all-time low. I was traipsing around like I’d just returned from a stint on the International Space Station.;;;;;;;;;
We found another path to lead us out of Ronda and followed it, telling ourselves we’d walk until the end.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave had been toying with the idea of walking the Camino for a while now, and our wander through the countryside only served to increase his desire.;;;;;;;;;
I totally got why he wanted to do it, because even though I’ve never been much of a walker, escaping the world and concentrating only on my feet sounded appealing;;;;;;;;;
“We could go offline for months,” I found myself suggesting every few minutes. “Each year, we could go on a long walk together. Stop working for a month or two, leave our laptops behind, and just walk.”;;;;;;;;;
I loved the solitude and the silence. That we had yet to spot a single person, or any signs of life. There was just a tiny track and the sound of our footsteps.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
This walk was the highlight of my time in Ronda. It gave me the chance to get away from the world, clear my head, and focus on nothing but putting one foot in front of the other.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So we walked and we walked, and then we walked some more. We walked for three hours, and with the end not yet in sight, I asked if we could turn back around. I was exhausted.;;;;;;;;;
Feeling like a failure, I trudged my way back to Ronda.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Guess what?!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

When we returned to our room, I began researching the track we’d been walking along. It turns out, it was part of the E4, a 10,000 kilometre-long walking route that runs from Southern Portugal to Greece!;;;;;;;;;
Suddenly, I didn’t feel quite so disheartened about turning back around.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What to Know About Visiting Ronda;;;;;;;;;
How to get there: You can grab a direct train from Granada and the journey takes two and half hours. Trains run five times a day and cost around 30 euros for a return ticket.;;;;;;;;;

Where to stay: We stayed at Hotel San Francisco for around $45 a night, and were really impressed. The continental breakfast was surprisingly good (as a rule, I always avoid continental breakfasts in hotels because they’re uniformly atrocious), and it was in a central location, a few minutes away from the main square. The room was clean, the staff were friendly, and the Wi-Fi came in at 3 Mbps. No complaints!;;;;;;;;;
Where to eat: Bodega Bar Restaurante was our favourite place to eat in Ronda — it’s a little outside of the main tourist area, and is a popular local haunt. Grab their tapas menu and order a dozen dishes (around a euro each) for a delicious lunch or dinner. My favourite dishes were the avocado pears, jamon croquettes, and fried anchovies.;;;;;;;;;
 If you’re looking for a cute breakfast spot, Sweet Bakery was the best spot we found, with plenty of pastries and smoothies to choose from. ;;;;;;;;;
Aaaand if you happen to have a craving for Indian food, like we did, hit up Curry & Grill. We were skeptical, but it was actually pretty good. Lots of spice, which is unusual for Spain! ;;;;;;;;;

The two weeks I spent there was one of the best trips I’ve taken in several years.;;;;;;;;;
And that was wonderful, because this was the first real trip I’d taken after ending my full-time travels and finding a base in Lisbon. I was nervous about it — I’d arrived in Lisbon so burnt out, so unwell, so stressed and anxious, and so over travel. So Greece was me dipping my toe back into the travel waters to see how I felt about it.;;;;;;;;;
Greece was me realising that I could never be fully over travel.;;;;;;;;;
Greece was me learning that finding a base was the best decision I could have ever made. That I can still travel as much as I used to, but that I function so much better when I have a home to return to between trips.;;;;;;;;;
Greece was the place that helped me rediscover the joy I once had for exploring new places.;;;;;;;;;
And while I took a slightly unconventional route around the country — visiting Corfu and sailing around the Ionian rather than hitting up Athens, Santorini, and Mykonos — I still fell madly in love.;;;;;;;;;
Here are the highlights from my time in Greece.;;;;;;;;;
My first meal in Greece: of course I had to go for the gyros and Greek salad!;;;;;;;;;
The Food, Of Course;;;;;;;;;
Like I could go to Greece and not write about the incredible food I found there!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I don’t think I had a single bad meal over the two weeks I spent in the country, even when I was eating in some no name town where I felt like I could be stabbed.;;;;;;;;;
My meals were all about the freshest Greek salads with enormous slabs of feta cheese on top: so good that I doubt I’ll ever eat a Greek salad outside of Greece again! It was all about the fresh bread and virgin olive oil. The tastiest olives I’ve ever tried. The rich moussakas. The tender kleftiko. The lamb souvlakis. The grilled octopus. It was ordering a plate of fried feta for an appetiser and that being perfectly acceptable.;;;;;;;;;
Practically everything I ate in Greece was the best version I’ve ever tasted of that dish, and it had the country shooting up into my top five places around the world in which to eat.;;;;;;;;;
I’m already planning a return to Greece next year and a lot of my motivation comes from missing the incredible food.;;;;;;;;;
Views from Corfu’s fortress;;;;;;;;;
Discovering that Corfu Isn’t Full of Chavs;;;;;;;;;
Corfu doesn’t have the greatest reputation in the U.K.;;;;;;;;;
It’s kind of known as a bit of a hotspot for chavs who are heading out on cheap package holidays to drink themselves to oblivion in their resorts. Even though we were heading to Corfu in the shoulder season, I was concerned that was all we’d experience there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But it wasn’t at all!;;;;;;;;;
Corfu Town doesn’t really attract the obnoxious British holidaymakers I was fearful of running into, and I fell in love with its chilled-out vibe. Wandering through the Old Town was my favourite activity from our four days there: I loved gazing up at the crumbling, colourful buildings and feta-hopping my way across the cafes and restaurants in town. And I can’t not mention Corfu’s old fortress, which was full of fascinating history (it’s been a part of so many sieges from the Ottomans over the years!) while still being fun to clamber all over.;;;;;;;;;
I would totally return to Corfu Town in the future and that’s something I never thought I would say!;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t take any photos in the museum, so here’s one of me and Dave on his birthday!;;;;;;;;;
Celebrating Dave’s Birthday at Corfu’s Banknote Museum;;;;;;;;;
You think I’m joking, but I’m not.;;;;;;;;;
Corfu’s banknote museum is easily one of the best museums I’ve ever been to. Entry to the museum was free and the old lady who worked there gave us an hour-long tour for free, too.;;;;;;;;;
And who knew that one of the best ways to learn about the history of a country is through its banknotes?;;;;;;;;;
We saw banknotes dating from 1822 (which were enormous) to the present day, some of which were issued during the Second World War by the occupation government, some bills were worth 100 billion drachmas due to hyperinflation after the war, and my favourite were the 5 drachma bills that were actually just 10 drachma notes that had been cut in half, because they’d been the smallest denomination at that time!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re ever in Corfu, go to the banknote museum! It’s so worth a visit.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Spending the Night Sleeping Under the Stars;;;;;;;;;
As our sailing trip drew to a close, one of our final nights on the yacht was spent tied up in a secluded bay with only a few other boats around for company.;;;;;;;;;
The water was so calm I felt as though I was on dry land, the other people on the yachts surrounding us were quiet so we barely knew they were there, and the night’s sky was cloudless. That night, Dave and I kept our hatch open so that we could look up at any point and see the Milky Way twinkling above us.;;;;;;;;;
This was easily my favourite place where we spent the night and I wish we could have stayed for longer.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Swimming in the Warmest, Clearest Ocean Ever;;;;;;;;;
I was expecting the water in Greece to be chilly, because that’s all I’ve ever experienced in the Mediterranean, so I was pleasantly surprised by just how warm the ocean was on our sailing trip — the temperatures were similar to what I’ve experienced in Southeast Asia!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And the visibility was ridiculous. We would be tied up in water depths of 20 metres and you could easily look down to the ocean floor and see the hundreds of fishes swimming beneath us.;;;;;;;;;
All of that transformed me from a nervous ocean swimmer to a water baby who was forever jumping off the side of the boat and spending all day splashing around in the sea.;;;;;;;;;
And you know what? It was so. much. fun.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Checking Out Kioni;;;;;;;;;
One of the prettiest places we stopped at on our sailing adventure was the cute fishing village of Kioni. I mean, just look at that location! I loved gazing up at the colourful buildings from the water and then later wandering through the olive groves and cypress trees.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
While we didn’t spend much time in this tiny village, it was the prettiest stop on our trip and I could have totally stayed there for several days.;;;;;;;;;
Mornings in Kalamos;;;;;;;;;
Mornings Spent Overlooking the Calm Ocean;;;;;;;;;
Mornings were my favourite time to be on the yacht. The water was calm, barely anyone else on neighbouring yachts were awake, so the only sound was the gentle lapping of water against the boat, and the sun was just high enough in the sky for it to be warm, but not sweat-inducing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Those mornings were some of my biggest highlights. Frying up eggs for breakfast with Dave in the kitchen, stretching out in the cockpit and reading my Kindle in the sunshine, and excitedly waiting to find out where we would be exploring later that day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Having Our Own Private Bay for the Day;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite days was when we moored up in a tiny bay on the island of Ithaca. That photo above shows pretty much the entire spot.;;;;;;;;;
We were the only yacht tied up here for the afternoon, meaning we had out own little bay to ourselves. We snorkelled with the fishes, swam out to the little beach to sunbathe, and basked up on deck, feeling like we were the only people around for miles.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Probably because we were.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Embracing My Sea Hair;;;;;;;;;
For as long as I can remember, I’ve hated my hair. Every hairdresser I’ve been to has commented on how thick and uncontrollable it is. It’s curly, it’s frizzy, and the smallest drop of water is enough to cause it to jump up into an afro.;;;;;;;;;
On the boat, however, I realised why so many people are obsessed with sea salt sprays for their hair. Thanks to all that sea water, I was able to let my hair hang free and natural, and it was far less frizzy than usual (here’s a photo of what my hair is usually like when I don’t do anything to it). I thought I’d go crazy without my hair straighteners to tame my hair, but I actually grew to love it.;;;;;;;;;
It’s great to know that if I ever did decide to buy a yacht and sail around the world, I wouldn’t have to worry about my wild mane getting in the way.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Moments with Vodka North;;;;;;;;;
On every sailing trip, there’s something called *The Moment*. It’s been a mainstay of every trip Dave and his friends have taken, and I love getting to join in with them.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Someone runs downstairs to blast out some music through the yacht’s speakers — always Mr Brightside by the Killers — someone else fills everyone’s cup with a generous pour of Vodka North (a Nordic berries-flavoured vodka that’s hard to find outside of Greece), and we all cheers to being in a beautiful part of the world. We then down our drink and jump off the side of the yacht into the water.;;;;;;;;;
This never fails to boost my mood and leave me feeling so alive.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Meerkating in Frikes;;;;;;;;;
Frikes was one of my favourite mooring spots, and it’s mostly because we were one of the first yachts to take our spot there. We were then in prime position in the harbour to do some meerkating.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The winds were strong in this part of Ithaca, and those coupled with the large wake from passing ferries meant that mooring was a bit of a challenge for anyone who arrived later on in the evening. And that meant we could spent our afternoons with a Vodka North in hand, wincing as we watched the disastrous attempts at mooring, backs straight and necks craned, looking just like meerkats.;;;;;;;;;
When we had dinner that night, we sat and watched someone attempt to moor for a full forty minutes in the darkness before giving up to head somewhere else.;;;;;;;;;
How Can You Sail the Ionian, Too?;;;;;;;;;
I’ve had quite a few readers reach out to ask how you can take a similar sailing trip around the Ionian, and given that I’m probably not going to be writing any more posts about Greece, I’mwhacking that information to the end of this post.;;;;;;;;;
We chartered a 47ft yacht through Sunsail, leaving from Lefkas, for an eight-day trip. It cost roughly $1000 per person for the week (there were only five of us, but we had enough room for eight people, so you could definitely cut down the costs if you travelled with more people).;;;;;;;;;
I was fortunate that both Dave and his best friend know how to sail, so we didn’t have to hire a captain for our trip. If you don’t know anyone who can sail, you can hire a skipper through Sunsail, who will sail the boat, moor for you, and take care of anything technical. It’ll be pricier to do this, but you’ll still be able to do essentially the same as we did, but without having to panic about how to actually sail.;;;;;;;;;
As you can tell, I’d definitely recommend the experience!;;;;;;;;;
Plotting My Return to Greece;;;;;;;;;
I know that practically every time I write a post about a place I’ve visited, I end it by talking about how I’m already making plans to return.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Greece is no exception, but I’m totally convinced I’ll revisit next year. I’m already putting together plans to head out for another sailing trip next autumn, and Dave and I are talking about heading back in the summer to check out the islands on the Aegean side.;;;;;;;;;
And to eat, of course.;;;;;;;;;
"Have you been to Greece? What was your highlight from your time there?""";;;;;;;;;
"1623407991-397,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/19"",""My Solo Travel Curse Continues in the Cook Islands"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/solo-travel-curse-cook-islands/"",""My Solo Travel Curse Continues in the Cook Islands"",""August 15, 2020"",""What is it with me and solo travel?";;;;;;;;;
I mean, seriously. Sometimes it feels as though every time I kiss Dave goodbye and enter an airport, I immediately stumble headfirst into disaster.;;;;;;;;;
As always, I was convinced the Cook Islands would be different.;;;;;;;;;
In fact, as Dave drove me to the airport in Christchurch, I merrily announced that I was certain no bad luck would befall me. I’ve been travelling for the better part of five years now, with over a year of that spent alone. I have common sense now. Sort of. I have life experience. I know what I’m doing. I know what to expect from travel. From hostels. From airports. From anything related to travel. I’d meticulously researched the Cook Islands; I’d booked everything in advance.;;;;;;;;
How could anything possibly go wrong?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I awoke on my first morning in Rarotonga to the sound of urgent whispers outside my jammed-open window.;;;;;;;;;
“Yeah, he’s talking to the cop now,” a girl muttered. “I doubt they’ll be able to catch them, but…”;;;;;;;;;
“You must have been so scared.”;;;;;;;;;
“It all just happened so fast. I didn’t really have time to even think about what was happening. And then James started running after them.”;;;;;;;;;
I sat bolt upright in bed and pulled my laptop towards me. I was filled with a sudden urge to live-tweet exactly what was happening. Except, a pop-up jumped all up in my screen to tell me that getting online would cost $10 per 100 mb, which is crazy-expensive. I closed my laptop back down, threw it in my daypack, padlocked it shut, and headed outside to see what had happened.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In the common room, I spotted a man in police uniform with a grave expression on his face. Beside him stood a guy in his thirties, gesturing wildly. I took a seat nearby and listened in on their conversation.;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t take long for me to discover that a local had broken into their beach bungalow overnight and tried to steal their stuff. The guy had woken up and chased him down the beach, but failed to catch him. It had been happening a lot lately: petty thefts along the beach; local kids prying on drunk travellers in the hope they might leave their valuables unattended.;;;;;;;;
I eyed the sign offering the use of a locker for a $10 key deposit, then went in search of the owner.;;;;;;;;;
“What?” he chuckled. “You don’t need a locker! You have a private room; your stuff is safe. Those guys were getting drunk on the beach and left their bungalow open. Stupid! You’ll be fine where you are.”;;;;;;;;
I didn’t know who to believe, so I returned to my room, tugged the curtains over my open window, slung my camera over my shoulder, and headed out to explore Rarotonga.;;;;;;;;;
The main road in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
I had a plan: I’d stop in at the nearest store to grab some sunscreen and insect repellent, then spend the day wandering around Rarotonga’s main town of Avarua. There were a couple of museums I wanted to check out, and my Lonely Planet had mapped out a walking route I could take to see the main attractions.;;;;;;;;;
So, I walked.;;;;;;;;;
And I walked.;;;;;;;;;
And I couldn’t stop walking.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Rarotonga was breathtakingly beautiful; so much more than I’d expected and, uh, there were no shops in sight. It was midday; the sun was scorching; and I still didn’t have any sunscreen. I could feel the skin on the back of my neck starting to tingle and I ceased taking photos to jog alongside the road.;;;;;;
If you’d asked me then, I’d tell you I walked for six hours until I found that rundown gas station, but my impending heatstroke had left me delirious. It was more like an hour before I spotted it. Right then, I should have taken the bus back to my hostel because I could tell my skin was burning, but this was my one full day in Rarotonga, so I couldn’t go back having seen nothing but the main road. I slapped four coats of sunscreen on my perspiring body and continued on.;;;;;;;;;
Moments later, I stumbled upon my favourite viewpoint on the island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
An hour later, I lined up to get jetblasted: Rarotonga’s airport is mere metres from the ocean, and standing on the road as the planes roar above you, is a wild ride that leaves your ears ringing for the rest of the day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wandered around the picturesque harbour in Avarua.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Then grabbed lunch at one of the cheap beach huts in town.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After lunch, it hit me how exhausted I was. I was drenched in sweat, my feet were aching from the fifteen kilometres I’d walked that day, I could tell that my skin was getting more and more burnt, despite me applying sunscreen every twenty minutes, and I had zero desire to explore more of Avarua.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I carried on anyway, because when would I next be in the Cook Islands? I might never come back, so I wanted to see everything and take it all in. I’d regret it if I went back now.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I walked thirty-five kilometres that day, and when I returned to my room, I let out a whimper, because I felt like shit. I sat on the edge of my bed and wondered if I should be angry or disappointed in myself: I’ve received enough hate comments over the years to know that people believe my “incidents” are just me making stupid decisions and never learning from them. I’m not the unluckiest traveller in the world; I’m just an idiot. But after experiencing so much anxiety over the last year, I was trying to practice self-love and stop blaming myself when things go wrong. But when things only ever go wrong when I’m travelling alone, it’s hard not to take it out on myself.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I should have bought sunscreen at the airport. I should have gone back to my hostel when I started getting burnt. I should have headed out later in the day when the sun wasn’t as strong. I should have turned back around when I was over it all in Avarua. I should have taken the bus home, rather than trudging back in flip-flops under the burning sun. ;;;;;;;;;
Better decisions only come to me in hindsight.;;;;;;;;;
When someone put their hand through my window at 2 a.m. and touched my head, I’m certain that growling and slamming my laptop lid up and down in an awkward rage wasn’t the right thing to do, but that was something I hadn’t been prepared for.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My eyes remained pinned open as I sat upright in bed for the rest of the night, eventually dragging myself out of my daze half an hour before my airport transfer. As I half-heartedly pushed everything I owned back into my pack, all I could think about was how terrible I felt. Two minutes before I was due to leave, I bolted to the bathroom and filled it with the contents of my stomach;;;;;;;;;

What was wrong with me?;;;;;;;;;
I still maintain that returning to my room, finishing my packing, and getting in the pickup truck to the airport was one of the toughest mental challenges I’ve ever faced. I plastered an awkward smile on my face and chatted to the hostel owner as we drove around the island, hoping he couldn’t smell my breath. The lagoon was spinning around me as I battled to keep my food down. I had pins and needles in my eyeballs. I was heading to Aitutaki: paradise on earth, and I’d booked myself into a great-sounding guesthouse as a treat. I just had to make it there without throwing up again.;;;;;;;;;
And, well, it’s not like I experience motion sickness on planes or anything…;;;;;;;;;
Oh man, that guesthouse was a disappointment. The free Wi-Fi that was advertised turned out to be a ridiculous $10 for 150 mb and my room was like being in a sauna. The fan spun uselessly in the room, barely generating a breeze and opening the windows and doors did nothing, so the room remained so goddamn hot all the goddamn time. It was so unbearable at night that I ended up wrapping myself in sheets, showering under cold water, and then curling up on the floor beside the open freezer in an attempt to stop sweating. Damn it, this was supposed to be a treat for me. I was supposed to be having the time of my life.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Optimism until my death! I woke up convinced I was going to have an amazing day on Aitutaki.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That morning, I opted to hire a bicycle, utilising my common sense after walking around Rarotonga had left me so broken. I set off with the wind in my hair, unable to hide my grin. I felt so free and happy to be here. I had been dreaming of visiting Aitutaki for years and it was just as beautiful as I’d imagined.;;;;;;;;;
I stopped at a grocery store to stock up on snacks, but it was closed. I stopped at another but it was also closed. As I continued to pedal my way around the island, I noticed that every building I passed was shuttered up. I would later come to discover that I’d chosen Sunday as my one day to explore to island — a day when the highly-religious Cook Islands shuts down to go to church. Everything I’d wanted to see was closed.;;;;;;;;;
Imagine a bicycle with the worst suspension you’ve ever come across and then imagine riding that bicycle over pot-holed roads for several hours. The nerves in my hands were shot by the end of the day and remained tingling for days afterwards.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I booked myself on a lagoon cruise for the next day, excited to explore Aitutaki from the water, but nervous about my seasickness. I brought my optimism back around after reading glowing reviews online and convinced myself that I was going to have an incredible day. And despite experiencing seasickness, it was an incredible day. I made friends, I snorkelled with giant glowing clams and swam with giant trevellies. I love travel, I thought to myself over and over until I felt as though my heart might explode.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of course, this is me and not even my lagoon cruise was free of incidents. Most notably, I showed everybody on my tour my vagina when I forgot how to enter the water from the boat. More on that later this week.;;;;;;;;;
The cruise drew to a close and then our boat broke down. In my head, I was all like, are you fucking kidding me? Of course the boat had broken down. Of course it had broken down in the middle of the lagoon under the steaming hot sun, rocking us from side to side until I was on the verge of throwing up. We sat for two hours and waited to be rescued.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A few days later, I had switched guesthouses and stocked up on food — which, in the Cook Islands usually means tinned food and chips. Everything I’d bought had been stale apart from the baked beans, so that was my dinner on my final night in the Cook Islands. I sat on my bed, watching episodes of Nashville, eating lukewarm baked beans out of a saucepan.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then I thought to myself: when I’d been at home planning my trip of a lifetime, did I ever picture it would look anything like this?;;;;;;;;;
I left the Cook Islands a few days later, having had an amazing but disastrous time. At Rarotonga Airport, about to fly to French Polynesia, an older guy approached me in the terminal and began to ask me a series of probing questions. Little did I know that he’d been following me all over Aitutaki, was on the same flight as me to Tahiti, and was staying in the same hostel that I’d booked there. Little did I know that I was about to start feeling very uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and little did I know that my bank had just blocked my card.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I went back and forth a few dozen times about publishing this post, and it’s part of the reason why my incidents page has been lean of new content for several years. I don’t want it to seem like I’m whining and complaining about what, in the grand scheme of things, isn’t that big of a deal. So I had a few crappy experiences — I got to have them in one of the prettiest places in the world. My life isn’t hard; my experiences weren’t traumatising. There are so many people who have it worse off. People are dying; I’m just showing everyone my vagina.;;;;;;;
But I decided to hit publish because I think it’s important to share the realities of my life on the road, regardless of how insignificant my incidents are to other people. My life isn’t perfect, my travels are far from it, and my pretty Instagram photos only share so much of the story. Sometimes travel can suck, sometimes you’ll have such a ridiculous string of bad luck that you’ll wonder why on earth you don’t just fly home, but it all works out in the end. I’m still alive, I’m still in love with exploring the world, I’m still wondering why I seem to be the unluckiest traveller I’ve ever met.;;;;;;;;;
"Coming up this week: a detailed account of my lagoon cruise in Aitutaki — the prettiest place I’ve ever been, even with the disasters! — and another incident post about the time I flashed my tour group!""";;;;;;;;;

Fortunately, I track every single cent that I spend while I’m on the road, so putting together a detailed breakdown of my year wasn’t too much trouble. I want to prove that travel isn’t as expensive as people assume and in 2015, I spent less than many people spend in a year at home.";;;;;;;;;
Over the past 12 months, I managed to visit 19 countries: Australia, Cambodia, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.;;;;;;;;;
I hit up 62 different cities.;;;;;;;;;
I travelled 24,613 miles.;;;;;;;;;
I took 15 flights.;;;;;;;;;
I slept in 35 beds.;;;;;;;;;
I spent $19,640.73 (£13,747).;;;;;;;;;
That’s an average of $53.80 per day.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s the breakdown:;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation: $6962.69;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Transportation: $4,619.34;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food: $6072.78;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Activities: $719.88;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Visas: $95.00;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Entrance Fees: $177.38;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel Insurance: $706.26;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Miscellaneous: $287.40;;;;;;;;;
Is it cheaper than you expected? It’s far less than I had assumed, given that this was the first year I made very little attempt to travel on a budget.;;;;;;;;;
This, therefore, is not a guide to how you can travel the world for the smallest amount of money possible — it’s about how travel is still affordable if you opt to stay in nice apartments, splurge on fancy hotels for special occasions, and don’t choose the most uncomfortable budget options available. It’s about how you can still spend less than many people would in a year at home, even on a mid-range budget.;;;;;;;;;
What can you expect to spend if you have more of a backpacker budget, and will be staying in dorm rooms in hostels, travelling overland, and staying in cheap regions of the world? $10,000 is doable for a year.;;;;;;;;;

Hiking in New Zealand;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation;;;;;;;;;
My total accommodation costs came in at $6962.69 for the year.;;;;;;;;;
In 2015, I stayed in a whole host of different accommodations, ranging from eight-bed dorms in Latvia to a luxury floating hotel in the middle of the Cambodian jungle. I opted to sleep in some pretty offbeat places, too, hitting up both a luxury yurt and shepherd’s hut in Cornwall, and a houseboat in the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;
This year was also the year of Airbnb. While I’m not a massive fan of the company’s business practices, I can’t deny how perfect it is for slow travellers like me. The monthly discounts on the site save me and my boyfriend, Dave so. much. money and I still can’t believe that staying in an entire house for a month with a kitchen and a dedicated Internet connection nearly always works out to be half the price of a month-long stay in a private room in a hostel.;;;;;;;;;
Not tried Airbnb yet? If you sign up using this link, you’ll receive $30 off your first stay!;;;;;;;;;
And speaking of slow travel, this year was also more about spending months in a new city rather than days, which helped me save money and get to know a place more that superficially. I spent three months inside working on a big project in Granada. I lived in Madrid for six weeks. I spent two separate months based in London. I lived in Taipei for four weeks, and spent a full month in Melbourne.;;;;;;;;;
The generosity of our friends and family around the world helped Dave and I further bring down the costs of our accommodation. We housesat for friends in Amsterdam and Melbourne, and stayed with both my and Dave’s family in the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, I have to note that if you were to travel on more of a backpacking budget, you could very easily bring the accommodation costs down to half of what I spent.;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to travel style, I’d estimate that 10% of my travels were on a backpacker budget, 80% were mid-range, and 10% were super-luxury! After five years of full-time travel, I’m grateful I can afford to have a few more comforts in my life :-);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Most Expensive Place I Stayed: The most expensive place I stayed at was the floating hotel in Cambodia, which came in at $175 a night. I booked this for Dave’s birthday and it was one of the highlights of my entire year of travel. I love splurging on places we’d never normally choose to stay at for special occasions!;;;;;;;;;
The Cheapest Place I Stayed: The cheapest place I stayed at was Munkenhof hostel in Tallinn ($13.39 a night), which also wins for the shortest length of time I stayed in a place and the worst place I’ve ever stayed in. I was attacked by bedbugs, somebody threw up in the bed above mine, and the hostel cleaner kicked me in the back. Ah, budget travel!;;;;;;;;;
The Longest I Stayed in One Place: That would have to be my Airbnb apartment in Granada, where I spent over three months! It was the perfect place to knuckle down and work non-stop.;;;;;;;;;
The Best Place I Stayed: That would have to be Tamu Hotel, on Otres Beach, in Cambodia. At around $120 a night, it wasn’t cheap, but having the penthouse suite and getting to wake up to this view was more than worth it.;;;;;;;;;

And because I’m a massive completionist and love numbers, I’ve compiled the average cost per night of every city I spent time in this year. Hopefully this should give you a good idea of what you can expect to pay in different regions around the world. I’ve also linked to the places I stayed at as the location name, in case you want to check them out! Anything marked with a * is somewhere I visited on my own or for Dave’s birthday, so the accommodation costs weren’t split.;;;;;;;;;

This year was a bit of an odd one when it came to transportation. I took a hell of a lot of flights for convenience and to save time, but because I was also travelling slowly, it still worked out to be affordable.;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to finding cheap flights, the easiest way to save money is by being flexible. If you don’t have set travel dates or destinations, you can look at prices across an entire month and pick the cheapest day. If don’t mind where you fly in to, you can look at flights to every airport in the country to see which will save you money. I usually do both and managed to score some great deals this year.;;;;;;;;;
I use only one site to find flights: Skyscanner. One of those will usually find me a kickass price. I find every other flight search website really annoying and unhelpful.;;;;;;;;;
Tubing in the Tatai River, in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
Most Expensive Flight: My flight from Madrid to Bangkok came in at $534.96. I had a last minute change of plans and booked it two weeks before the departure date, and had zero flexibility because I wanted to be on the same flight as Dave. He booked his flight four months before me and it cost half the price.;;;;;;;;;

Avocado Eggs from Industry Beans, in Melbourne: an Australian classic!;;;;;;;;;
Food;;;;;;;;;
My total cost for food and drinks (both eating out and grocery shopping) came to: $6072.78;;;;;;;;;
Food is nearly always one of my biggest expenses when I travel, because life’s too short to have a bad meal. When I’m staying in an Airbnb apartment, I’ll typically eat breakfast at home and eat out for lunches and dinners. One of the things I both love and hate about this lifestyle is getting to eat out for every single meal, but also that it makes me fat.;;;;;;;;;

At the start of the year, I set myself a challenge to do more activities as I travel, so I think I did pretty abysmally on that front. I was so wrapped up in work for the first half of the year that I barely left my apartment, then spent the second half experiencing panic attacks as I recovered from the stress of that work. Trying new things wasn’t high on my list this year. Here’s what I did manage to squeeze in:;;;;;;;;;
Spain: Food tasting experience in Granada: $43.04;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Netherlands: Running tour in Maastricht: $27.95;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Entrance fees for attractions are typically pretty low for me. I’m not a huge museum freak and can be lazy about exploring the tourist hotspots when I’m staying in a city long-term. I’ve found that the longer I travel, the more I prioritise wandering through markets, meeting and chatting to locals, and hanging out with friends. Here’s my breakdown of entrance fees for the year:;;;;;;;;;
Spain: Entrance fee for Ronda Arab baths: $3.29;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Spain: Entrance fee for Ronda bullring: $7.13;;;;;;;;;

This year, my visa fees were pretty low. I spent much of the year in Europe, and had a short enough stint in Thailand and Vietnam that I could get their free visas on arrival. Australian visas are free for British citizens, but due to a fuck-up on my end, where I forgot to apply for one, I had to pay for a rushed visa.;;;;;;;;;
Cambodian visa: $30.00;;;;;;;;;

Australian visa: $65.00;;;;;;;;;

Travel insurance is my one essential, and I never go anywhere without it! I always go with World Nomads, because they make insurance easy for long-term travellers. They’re one of the few companies where you can buy or renew your policy while you’re not in your home country. Any experience I’ve had with calling them or claiming from them has been trouble-free and easy.;;;;;;;;;

Beautiful Granada: my home for three months of the year!;;;;;;;;;
What Wasn’t Included;;;;;;;;;
It was tricky figuring out which expenses to include and which to leave out, and I know I won’t be able to please everyone. There’s being transparent about every expense I incurred and being irrelevant. Here’s what wasn’t included:;;;;;;;;;
Business expenses: Sharing how much I spent on hosting Never Ending Footsteps and the various subscriptions I have to companies didn’t seem relevant for someone who is going to travel for a year. If you’re interested, I share how much I spend on these in my monthly summaries. It’s typically around $100 a month or so.;;;;;;;;;
Cancelled travel expenses: I spent $3000 on a trip to the Seychelles, Mauritius, and the Maldives, but was suffering from such severe anxiety that I had to cancel my plans. This didn’t feel all that relevant for most people!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Birthday presents for family: This didn’t seem too helpful to include.;;;;;;;;;
Replacing my clothes: This year, I spent several hundred dollars replacing every item of clothing I have in my backpack. Most travellers who head out for a year won’t have the need to do this.;;;;;;;;;
A new camera: I splurged and threw down $2,500 on a new camera this year to improve the photos on this site. Most travellers won’t need something this fancy and wouldn’t be likely to buy one mid-way through their trip.;;;;;;;;;
To those of you who are commenting to say you could do it for far less, me too! I didn’t keep such a detailed track of my expenses when I first started traveling, but you can read about how my first year of travel cost me $13,000. I stayed in dorm rooms in hostels, ate fast food, and travelled mostly overland.;;;;;;;;;
After five years of full-time travel, though, I started to crave home comforts, so decided to transition from more of a budget style of travel to something mid-range. The upgrade is worth it to me :-);;;;;;;;;
And those are my 2015 expenses! I hope you found this post useful! What do you think — is $20,000 less or more than you thought it would cost to travel for a year?;;;;;;;;;

When I first decided I wanted to see the world — potentially long-term — I decided I needed to have a trial run first. I wanted to stay in a hostel for the first time, see what it was like to explore as a backpacker, and work out if I had the courage to quit my job to travel.;;;;;;;;;
I chose to spend five days in Amsterdam, and those days are what led me to where I am today. Because flying to the Netherlands helped me to fall in love with travel and learn that it wasn’t so terrifying after all. Two months after that trip, I stepped on a plane with a one-way ticket in hand and now, eight years later, I’ve built a career around travel and do this for a living.;;;;;;;;;
The Netherlands, therefore, holds a special place in my heart. I try to return regularly.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve now visited this country five times, as a backpacker, as part of a couple on a tight budget, and as a mid-range solo traveller that’s looking for comfort and good value above all else. I’ve spent six weeks there in total, visiting Amsterdam, Utrecht, Keukenhof, Leiden, Maastricht, and the Hague — and I’ve loved each and every place.;;;;;;;;;
So, let’s talk about travel expenses.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve been recording every single cent I spend in the countries I visit from day one of my travels, because I want to prove that seeing the world is inexpensive and achievable. I want to be able to give a realistic and accurate look at how much you can expect to spend in each country you visit.;;;;;;;;;
Today, it’s the Netherlands’ turn. I averaged 64 EUR per day while I was there, and the following blog post gets deep into the specifics.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how much you can expect to spend on a trip to the Netherlands, then, in 2019.;;;;;;;;;
Tulips in Amsterdam — you can’t get more Dutch than that!;;;;;;;;;
How to Save Money on Accommodation in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
As you guys know, I always try to cover all possible budgets in my breakdowns, so I’ll kick things off by focusing on the backpackers among us. If you’re on a tight budget and want to spend as little as possible on travel, these are my accommodation recommendations for keeping costs low.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Couchsurfing exists in the Netherlands, and allows you to stay with a local for free, sleeping on their couch, and gaining a more authentic look into life in this country. This is probably going to appeal more to my younger readers, as you can imagine it’s not the most comfortable of circumstances, but if you’re willing to sacrifice a little, you’ll be able to keep your travel costs low. You can search for potential hosts in the Netherlands here.;;;;;;;;;
Housesitting is another option, which is more suitable for those of you who prefer a little more comfort in your life. Through a housesitting website, you’ll be able to apply to take care of somebody’s house for free while they’re away, usually looking after their pets, too. It’s best for long-term travellers or retirees, as you can’t pick and choose dates and destinations, so you need to have a lot of flexibility as to where you go and at what time of year. If you do have that freedom, it’s a wonderful way to cut down your travel expenses, soak up some home comforts (some of my friends have landed gigs housesitting in castles!), and live like a local for a while. Trusted Housesitters is one of the best sites for getting started with housesitting.;;;;;;;;;
And finally, if you’re travelling long-term and don’t mind getting some work done in order to save money, you could have a go at WWOOFing (here) or WorkAway (here). Both sites allow you to work for a local in exchange for accommodation and food — in WWOOFing’s case, it’s working on organic farms, and with WorkAway it can be anything from helping out a local hostel to converting a freighter into a houseboat. It’s not usually the most glamorous of experiences, but getting to live for free in a foreign country is an incredible experience, so if you’re backpacking around Europe, this may be the way forward for you.;;;;;;;;;
I’m suspecting, though, that for most of you, you’re not interested in the free accommodation and just want somewhere clean, safe, and affordable to rest your head each night. If that’s the case, there are several options available for you.;;;;;;;;;
The first of these is, of course, hostels. In the Netherlands, you’ll come across hostels all over the country, finding them in major cities, in small towns, in houseboats, and even in windmills. They’re one of your best options for saving money. Unfortunately, it’s rare to find ones with consistently amazing reviews, so if you can find anywhere with a rating that’s above a 9, you’re doing well.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hostels in the Netherlands are still fairly expensive relative to much of the world, eye-wateringly so in summer. You should plan to spend a minimum of €30 a night for a bed in a dorm room in Amsterdam, with prices dropping to around €20 a night for a dorm bed in the rest of the country.;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to private rooms in hostels, you’ll obviously be looking at a little more. For a clean, modern room in a central location, plan to spend around €70 a night, with the price jumping to as much as €100 a night in Amsterdam. If you’re travelling with a friend or partner, you may find it’s a similar price to pay for a private room rather than two dorm beds, which I’d recommend doing if you value your privacy.;;;;;;;;;
If you’re put off by the thought of nights spent in hostels, you shouldn’t be! Private rooms are usually very quiet and clean, and most hostels are modern, safe, and centrally located. They tend to have a little more personality than generic hotels, and the staff are fantastic at offering travel advice. As long as you check the reviews of any hostel before booking it to make sure nobody refers to it as a party hostel, you’re all good to make a booking there.;;;;;;;;;
But let’s move on from hostels.;;;;;;;;;
Airbnb is another option you might want to keep in mind, as staying in a private room with a local on Airbnb can often work out to be as affordable as a night in a hostel. You’ll be looking at around €50 a night for a private room on Airbnb. I usually recommend not staying in an entire Airbnb apartment for ethical reasons, so go for a private room so you’re not contributing to housing crises in beautiful cities around the world. You can find Airbnb apartments in the Netherlands here.;;;;;;;;;
And, of course, there are always hotels, which will usually start at around €100 a night in the Netherlands. You’ll have slightly more luxury and comfort in hotels, so it’s up to you to work out whether this is worth the additional expense. I always use HotelsCombined to find guesthouses and hotels when I travel, as they compare the prices between sites like Booking, Agoda, Expedia, and more. I’m always surprised to learn how much the price varies between different websites — Booking isn’t always cheapest!;;;;;;;;;

The Best Hostels and Guesthouses in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
As I mentioned above, I’ve visited the Netherlands during various stages of my travel career, both as a backpacker who was travelling on a shoestring budget and as part of a couple that was looking for all things private and mid-range. While I’ve not yet have the pleasure of visiting the Netherlands on a high-end, luxury AF budget, I believe I’ve learned a lot about how to receive good value throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;

I always like to share which accommodation I stayed in on my travels, as well as recommend alternatives when mine sucked. Everywhere I recommend below has excellent reviews and offers great value for money.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s my list of some of the best accommodation options in the Netherlands:;;;;;;;;;
Amsterdam — JamieK’s B&B (€138 a night): If you’re looking for somewhere spacious and comfortable, in a great location, and with an incredibly welcoming host, JamieK’s B&B is the place to go for, if you can afford it. With a rating of 9.5 on Booking, this is one of the consistently best reviewed places in the city, so you really can’t go wrong with it.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Utrecht — B&B De Klinkende Munt (€100 a night): This cosy guesthouse is easily the best value accommodation in the city of Utrecht — receiving an average review of 9.8 and not being outrageously expensive means that this is an excellent option for the city. The B&B gives you access to a large apartment that’s close to the central train station, which is good for those of you who are travelling around the country by train. The staff are lovely, the breakfast’s fantastic, and the heated bathroom floors are a nice touch, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
→ Check rates for B&B De Klinkende Munt;;;;;;;;;
Leiden — Ibis Leiden Centre (€98 a night): I based myself in Leiden while visiting Keukenhof Gardens, and chose to stay at the Ibis Leiden while I did so. It was one of the cheapest options in the city that still received great reviews, and overall, I was really happy with my stay there. There isn’t anywhere else in a similar price range that I’d recommend. Our room was clean and modern, the staff were helpful, it was close to some great restaurants and bars, and there was a delicious breakfast on offer.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Maastricht — HollaCachet (€82 a night): I love Maastricht! It’s such a cool city. When it comes to accommodation, HollaCachet is the cheapest spot in the city that still receives great reviews — which is pretty cool, as this place has an interesting history. It was once an old cow shed that was then converted into a B&B that’s only been open since late-2018. The only downside is that it’s a few miles outside of Maastricht, so you’ll need to catch the bus (the stop is nearby) into the centre of town if you don’t have a car.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
→ Check rates for HollaCachet | Read reviews on TripAdvisor;;;;;;;;;
The Hague — Veenkade B&B (€107 a night): Located just a few minutes walk from the centre of the city, this B&B receives exceptionally good reviews. You’ll be staying in a lovely spacious apartment with friendly owners, and lightning-fast Wi-Fi. It’s close to a supermarket and has a well-equipped kitchen, so if you feel like cooking for yourself one night, that’s definitely possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
→ Check rates for Veenkade B&B;;;;;;;;;
Rotterdam — City Hub Rotterdam (€61 a night): This is easily the best place in the city to stay! City Hub Rotterdam is a super-futuristic, very modern type of accommodation that’s more luxurious than uncomfortable. In a place that’s known for unusual architecture, I recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and staying somewhere quirky to match. Ah! This place is so cool.;;;;;;;;;

Probably the most Dutch scene ever — I snapped this photo on a sunny day in Leiden;;;;;;;;;
How to Save Money on Transportation in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
One of the best ways to get around the Netherlands is by train. When I spent three weeks exploring the country, I travelled everywhere by rail and found it to be comfortable, easy, and inexpensive relative to the prices of other things here. The public transportation system is seriously impressive, too — its infrastructure is ranked fourth in the world — and other countries should take note.;;;;;;;;;
So, how much can you expect to spend on transport in the Netherlands?;;;;;;;;;
The first thing you’ll need to do upon arriving is pick up an OV–chipkaart, which is an essential for travel in this country. The chipkaart is what you’ll use throughout the Nethelrnads on the trains, metros, trams, and buses — the country no longer issues paper tickets, so you’ll need one of these in order to use public transport.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It costs €7.50 to buy an OV-chipkaart from a machine, which you can find at all train and metro stations, as well as some supermarkets, and you can top it up from these machines, too. Like many transportation systems around the world, you’ll pay for the total distance of your trip, so you’ll definitely want to make sure you swipe out at the end of your journey. If you don’t plan on using it much, you can buy a single-use chipkaart for just €1. The card works across the entire country.;;;;;;;;;
As I mentioned before, I wholeheartedly recommend travelling by train. Here’s what I paid for my trips across the country:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Train from Amsterdam to Utrecht: €9;;;;;;;;;
Train from Utrecht to Leiden: €10;;;;;;;;;
Train from Leiden to Maastricht: €35;;;;;;;;;
Train from Maastricht to the Hague: €26;;;;;;;;;
Train from the Hague to Amsterdam: €13;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d personally advise against driving in the Netherlands. While renting a car will give you greater flexibility, parking is hard to find and expensive, and navigating streets filled with bicycles, trams, and pedestrians can be stressful. The only exception would be if you want to visit teeny-tiny villages that the trains don’t pass through — given that there are 400-odd train stations in the country, though, this is unlikely to be the case.;;;;;;;;;
Flying is typically expensive and time-consuming, so you’ll want to skip out on that if at all possible. You’ll save money and see a lot more of the country by travelling overland.;;;;;;;;;
Bitterballen! This is my absolutely favourite Dutch treat, and you have to try it while you’re in the country! They’re little fried balls of amazingness, and the perfect snack food to accompany a beer in the sunshine.;;;;;;;;;
How to Save Money on Food in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
Food can be pricey in the Netherlands, but there are plenty of ways to cut costs while you travel around this tasty country.;;;;;;;;;

Cooking is always going to be more affordable than eating out, so if you’re willing to sacrifice some meals on your vacation, this is a great way to keep on track with your budget. Hostels will usually give you access to a shared kitchen, and if you’re opting for an Airbnb, you’ll likely be able to use the kitchen, too. If that’s the case, you can head to a local market (a great cultural experience!) and stock up on fish, vegetables, and fruits, and spend far less on your meals than you would at a restaurant.;;;;;;;;;
Many hostels and hotels will offer free breakfasts within their room rate, so if that’s the case, I always recommend eating later in the morning and eating a lot of food, as you may find you’re too full to have lunch. A lot of accommodation I recommended above are B&Bs with fantastic breakfasts, so factor that into the overall cost of your stay. If hotels do charge for buffet breakfasts, you can expect to spend around €15-20 for them.;;;;;;;;;
You’re also going to want to opt for a larger lunch and a smaller dinner. Most restaurants charge less for their lunch menus, even though they’re serving the exact same meal for lunch and dinner. If you can eat a bigger meal for lunch, you can then get by with a much smaller one for dinner and save money through doing so.;;;;;;;;;
In general, you should expect to spend the following per person on each meal:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Breakfast: €10 for a cooked breakfast with tea/coffee;;;;;;;;;
Lunch: €8 each for a sandwich/slice of pizza from a deli with a soft drink;;;;;;;;;
Dinner: €10 each if you’re on a budget, €20 each for a mid-range restaurant, €40+ each for something higher-end.;;;;;;;;;

I don’t often have much success with this suggestion, but I do recommend keeping an eye on your drink consumption while travelling in the Netherlands. Alcohol is obviously a big budget buster on the road (and wines can be quite pricey in Dutch restaurants), so if you’re happy to substitute the sodas, juices, and alcohol for tap water, you’ll save a ton of money. And yes, the tap water is safe to drink in the Netherlands, so you really don’t need to worry about buying bottled water.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Stroopwafel! These Dutch waffles consist of two biscuits squished together with a caramel centre. They are DELICIOUS. Eat them all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re determined to jump headfirst into the Dutch food scene and don’t want to spend your vacation cooking, you should look to eat at the ethnic restaurants in town. There’s a huge population of Indonesians and Surinamese in the Netherlands, and their cuisines make for some tasty cheap eats while you’re exploring the country.;;;;;;;;;
You can always ask the locals for food recommendations, too! Ask at your accommodation for recommendations on the best budget eats and they’ll be unlikely to steer you wrong.;;;;;;;;;
Here are some typical prices of food in the Netherlands to help you budget better:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Combo meal at McDonald’s: €7.50;;;;;;;;;
Pint of draught beer: €2.50;;;;;;;;;
A glass of house wine in a restaurant: €5;;;;;;;;;
A slice of pizza: €3.50;;;;;;;;;
Sandwich from a deli with soft drink: €8;;;;;;;;;
Litre of milk: €0.75;;;;;;;;;
A loaf of bread: €1.20;;;;;;;;;
A dozen eggs: €2.50;;;;;;;;;
1 kilogram of tomatoes: €2.50;;;;;;;;;
1 kilogram of potatoes: €1.60;;;;;;;;;
A 1.5l bottle of water: €0.90;;;;;;;;;
A steak dinner with a glass of wine: €40;;;;;;;;;
A serving of bitterbollen: €6.50;;;;;;;;;
A pack of stroopwafels: €4;;;;;;;;;
A gyros for lunch with a soft drink: €4.50;;;;;;;;;
A three course meal and wine in a high-end restaurant in Amsterdam: €60 each;;;;;;;;;

How to Save Money on Activities in the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
We’ve covered accommodation, transportation, and food, but let’s face it: you’re not going to have the trip of a lifetime if you skip out on entrance fees and activities! If I was going to recommend just a couple of experiences to have, I’d suggest checking out the tulips at Keukenhof (if you’re visiting in spring), heading out into the countryside (Giethoorn looks incredible!), and jumping on a food tour.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s a breakdown of the activity costs you’re likely to encounter while travelling around the Netherlands:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Entrance to Anne Frank House: €10;;;;;;;;;
Entrance to the Rijksmuseum: €19;;;;;;;;;
Entrance to Keukenhof Gardens: €18;;;;;;;;;
Windmills and countryside tour from Amsterdam with cheese tasting: €120;;;;;;;;;
Skip-the-line tickets to Keukenhof Gardens and a local tulip farm from Amsterdam: €60;;;;;;;;;
Red Light District walking tour with local guide: €21;;;;;;;;;
Cycling tour of Amsterdam: €27;;;;;;;;;
Canal cruise in Amsterdam: €25;;;;;;;;;
Giethoorn day trip from Amsterdam: €95;;;;;;;;;
Private walking tour of Rotterdam with river cruise: €110;;;;;;;;;
Running tour of Maastricht: €21 — I loved this tour when I took it a couple of years ago!;;;;;;;;;
Day trip to Bruges, Belgium from Amsterdam: €95;;;;;;;;;
Amsterdam Jordaan district food tour: €80;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are plenty of free activities to participate in, too, while you’re in the Netherlands, and I know that I had a fantastic time simply wandering through the cities, exploring local markets, admiring the windmills and tulips, and making the most of the museums that don’t charge an entrance fee.;;;;;;;;;
If, like me, you love taking tours to get to know a country better, I recommend heading to Viator for inspiration. They have a whole range of activities and tours available, and I book 95% of the tours I take through them.;;;;;;;;;
I loved this display at Keukenhof — one of the highlights of my time in the country!;;;;;;;;;
Miscellaneous Items to Buy for a Trip to the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;
A Netherlands guidebook: A guidebook will give you an in-depth look into Dutch culture, suggest the perfect itineraries for the amount of time you have, and offer recommendations for where to eat and what’s worth doing. I like Lonely Planet guidebooks, and their Netherlands offering receives great reviews.;;;;;;;;;

Travel insurance: If you’ve read any other posts on Never Ending Footsteps, you’ll know that I’m a great believer in travelling with travel insurance. I’ve seen far too many Go Fund Me campaigns from destitute backpackers that are unexpectedly stranded in a foreign country after a scooter accident/being attacked/breaking a leg with no way of getting home or paying for their healthcare. In short, if you can’t afford travel insurance, you can’t afford to travel. These costs can quickly land you with a sic-figure bill to pay at the end of it.;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance will cover you if your flight is cancelled and you need to book a new one, if your luggage gets lost and you need to replace your belongings, if you suddenly get struck down by kidney stones and have to be hospitalised, have your camera stolen and need to buy a replacement, or discover a family member has died while you’re overseas and need to get home immediately. If you fall seriously ill, your insurance will cover the costs to fly you home to receive medical treatment.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve used World Nomads as my travel insurance provider since 2012 and have had nothing but wonderful things to say about them.;;;;;;;;;

How Much Did I Spend on My Trip to the Netherlands?;;;;;;;;;
I always like to share my own personal expenses when travelling in a country, as I think it helps you figure out what you should be expecting to pay each day while you’re there. A list of expenses is great and helpful, of course, but putting them all together in order to come up with a reasonable estimate can be trickier.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s what I’ve spent on average over my month in the Netherlands:;;;;;;;;;
Accommodation: €25 per day ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Transportation: €2.50 per day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Food: €34 per day;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Activities: €2.25;;;;;;;;;
My average daily cost of travel in the Netherlands was therefore: €64 per day. Not bad at all!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I love this country so much and I can’t recommend visiting enough. Not only is it full of beautiful scenery and wonderful locals, but it’s relatively inexpensive, too. And the food. Mexico is worth visiting for the food alone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve spent a whopping seven months travelling in Mexico, and I’ve tracked every single Peso I spent while doing so. I’ve spent three months hanging out on the Pacific coast, two months in central mountain ranges, and six weeks making my way around the Yucatan. I’ve seen a hell of a lot of this incredible country and I’m excited to share this detailed budget breakdown with you all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re wondering how much it costs to travel in Mexico, keep on reading.;;;;;;;;;

Chichen Itza is incredible! You have to check it out if you decide to head to the Yucatan;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Accommodation in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to saving money on accommodation, there are several options for budget travellers.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The first of these are hostels. Mexico has hostels in most major city and towns across the country, and they’re one of your best options for saving money while still making friends. I always recommend staying in hostels if you’re going to be travelling alone!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hostels in Mexico are similarly priced to Central America or Southeast Asia, so you can get by on not very much at all. You can expect to spend around $10-15 a night for a dorm bed, and $30 for a private room, so if you’re travelling as part of a couple, you may find you end up spending similar amounts for a private room, as opposed to going with two beds in a dorm.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re an older traveller and put off by the thought of staying in hostels, don’t be! You can stay in a private room to still receive privacy and quiet, you’re unlikely to be the oldest person there, and most hostels these days are modern, clean, and centrally located. There are plenty of older travellers in hostels in Mexico, from middle-aged couples to solo septuagenarians on a trip of a lifetime. As long as you check the reviews of any hostel you book to make sure nobody refers to them as a party hostel, you’ll be all good.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Airbnb is another option that you’re going to want to keep in mind, as staying in a private room (rather than renting out the entire apartment) with a local can often work out to be more affordable as spending a night in a hostel, especially if you’re a couple. Head on over to the Airbnb website and you’ll find accommodation for as little as $20 a night. You’ll be more comfortable than you would be in a hostel, receive faster internet, and will get to hang out with the locals, which is what travel’s all about! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re on a really tight budget, there are options in Mexico that mean getting to explore the country for free. Couchsurfing has been a budget travel staple for over a decade now, and there are hundreds of thousands of hosts across the country. You’ll be able to stay for free with a local and gain an insight into life in Mexico that’s tough to experience when staying with other travellers in hostels.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Housesitting is another option if you’re going to be travelling without fixed plans. The best option is Trusted Housesitters for Mexico, and you’ll want to look at arranging this as far in advance as possible. Housesitting allows you to stay in someone’s house for free, usually while taking care of their pets, and is a great way to travel slowly across Mexico without spending much money at all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, when it comes to free accommodation, you could also check out WWOOFing. You’ll receive free accommodation and food in exchange for working on a local organic farm for a few hours every day. You’ll likely make tons of new friends, learn a new skill, and see a side of Mexico that few travellers get to experience. WorkAway is another option in Mexico that’ll give you free board in exchange for a more diverse choice of work.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Gorgeous Guanajuato is one of my favourite spots in Mexico! I highly recommend visiting this colourful city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Transportation in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Mexico’s a big country, but fortunately, it’s home to a solid public transportation system.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus is one of my favourite ways to explore the country, and it’s one of the cheapest, too. If you’re going to be travelling south of Mexico City, I can’t recommend the bus company ADO enough. They run luxury buses throughout this part of the country, offering comfortable reclining seats, air conditioning, and Wi-Fi. They’re seriously up-market buses and well-worth paying for. I include some of their prices at the end of this section.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For smaller distances, you’ll be able to utilise colectivos, which are minivans that fit around 12 people. Just jump on board, tell the driver where you want to go, wait for the other people to get in, and then stop when you’re at your stop. They’re very affordable. I travelled by colectivo between Playa del Carmen and Akumal (M$25/$1) and it as super-efficient, easy to use, and reasonably comfortable.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, trains don’t really exist in Mexico, with a couple of exceptions. Something that’s been on my Mexico wishlist for a while now is the Copper Canyon Railway, which runs through Mexico’s Copper Canyon and takes around 16 hours. There’s also a train that runs between Guadalajara and Tequila, which is known as the Tequila Express. Aside from those two journeys, though, you won’t be riding the rails while you’re in Mexico.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Once you’re on the ground, taxis are prevalent and Uber is available within several major destinations, like Mexico City, Cancun, Guanajuato, Tijuana, and Puerto Vallarta. There’s also the Cabify app, which works similar to Uber, to check out, too. If you take regular cabs, you can expect to pay around M$20 to M$25 per km — as with basically every country  in the world, expect to have a struggle to find a taxi driver that’s using their meter!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re confident about driving in another country, you could always look into renting a car to explore the country. I have several friends who have done this and were surprised by how safe it felt to do so. They had no major incidents! A week-long car hire out of Cancun costs $100 for an economy option, so the prices aren’t too bad. I use Skyscanner to find the cheapest car rentals.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, I want to talk about flying in Mexico. If the distances are large (say you want to travel from Puerto Vallarta to Cancun), it makes more sense to fly. Mexico is a vast country and overland distances can take many days. I flew from Guanajuato to Cancun to save on the journey time and it ended up costing just $50.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here are some typical overland transportation costs you’ll come up against while you’re travelling in Mexico:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bus ride from Cancun Airport to Tulum: M$262 ($14)Bus ride from Tulum to Playa del Carmen: M$88 ($5)Bus ride from Playa del Carmen to Valladolid: M$156 ($8)Bus ride from Mexico City to Oaxaca: M$332 ($17)Bus ride from Mexico City to Puebla: M$98 ($6)Bus ride from Puerto Vallarta to Sayulita: M$42 ($2)Ferry ride from Playa del Darmen to Cozumel: M$200 ($11);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tacos! You’re going to want to eat as many as possible of these while you’re in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Food in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If the food doesn’t end up being the highlight of your time in Mexico, I’ll be more than shocked. After all, I’m the person who regularly plans trips to Mexico for the sole reason of eating as much food as possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In fact, Mexico is my number one country in the world for eating.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And most exciting of all? The local food in Mexico is so cheap! You can get by on $1 a meal if you’re on a tight budget, but if you’re willing to splurge, you’ll be looking at paying as much as $5-10 per meal. It’s all so inexpensive. And delicious! Have I mentioned that it’s delicious?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One dish that you have to try in Mexico is cochinita pibil — it’s my favourite thing to eat in the country! Cochinita pibil is pulled pork shoulder that’s been slow-roasted and braised in achiote, orange juice, and lime. Throw some pickled onions on top, and you have the most incredible dish. It’s tender, tangy, full of flavour, and you can eat it in sandwiches and tacos for a dollar or two. You’ll find it everywhere in the Yucatan.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tacos are probably going to fuel your Mexico sightseeing activities, as they’re cheap, delicious, and easy to find. You’ll eat them in a corn tortilla rather than a flour one that’s more popular in Western countries, and there are dozens of different flavours to choose from.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourites is tacos al pastor, which features schwarma-style pork and grilled pineapple, but I also love the chorizo, carnitas (deep-fried pork), and carne asada. In case you hadn’t realised, yes, I’m a big fan of pork.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Does Tulum have one of the best beaches in Mexico? Yup!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Activities in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The cost of your activities are going to vary based on which part of the country you’re going to be visiting. In the Yucatan, much of your pesos will be spent on ruin-hopping and jungle-trekking; on the Pacific Coast, you’ll all about whale-watching and surfing.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
These are the entrance fees (2019) to many of the popular attractions across the country:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Entrance to Chichen Itza: M$242 ($13)Entrance to Coba ruins: M$75 ($4)Entrance to Tulum ruins: M$70 ($3.50)Entrance to Cenote Dos Ojos: M$350 ($18)Entrance to Guanajuato’s Mummy Museum: M$50 ($3)Entrance to Mexico City’s National Museum of Anthropology: M$70 ($4)Entrance to Oaxaca’s Hierve el Agua waterfalls: M$25 ($1.50)Entrance to Mexico City’s Frida Kahlo Museum: M$25 ($1.50)Entrance to a Lucha Libre wrestling match: M$100 ($5);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As you can see, the attractions are all pretty reasonably priced. Let’s now take a look at the typical activities you can do in Mexico, as well as their costs. Whenever I visit a country, I always make sure to check out the tours that are available on Viator. I book 99% of the tours I take through there and have never been disappointed. Here’s a selection of their most popular tours with five-star reviews from travellers:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Early entrance to Chichen Itza, accompanied by an archaeologist: $55Sightseeing and Snorkelling catamaran cruise from Cancun: $65Rio Secreto underground river tour: $85Ethical swim with whale sharks tour from Cancun: $144Luxury sailing and snorkelling tour from Cabo San Lucas: $84Downtown Puerto Vallarta food tour: $52Mexico City market and street food tour: $45Cozumel tequila tasting tour with chocolate workshop: $80Jungle buggy tour from Playa del Carmen with cenote swimming: $90Snorkelling tour to the famous Marietas Islands from Sayulita: $100;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Overall, then, if you’re going to be travelling to Mexico on a budget, you can see that the activities are really going to be where your costs start to increase. Still, I don’t think the prices for the tours are outrageous — they’re similar to what you’d pay in the U.S. — although they may be something you’ll want to skip out on if you’re watching your money.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Travel insurance: Travel insurance is my one travel essential! I firmly believe that if you skip out on buying insurance, you shouldn’t be travelling. The consequences of traveling uninsured can be disastrous. Fall and break a limb in the middle of the Mexican jungle? The cost of being airlifted home could easily soar into the six figures.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve seen far too many Go Fund Me campaigns from destitute backpackers who have been unexpectedly stranded in a foreign country after a scooter accident/being attacked/breaking a leg with no way of getting home or paying for their healthcare.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance will cover you if your flight is cancelled and you need to book a new one, if your luggage gets lost and you need to replace your belongings, if you suddenly get struck down by kidney stones and have to be hospitalised, have your camera stolen and need to buy a replacement, or discover a family member has died while you’re overseas and you need to return home immediately.

Departure tax: One thing you’ll want to pay attention to as you buy your transport to Mexico is whether the departure tax has been included in your booking. For most airlines, it will have been, but if it’s not, or if you’ll be travelling into Mexico overland, you’ll be up for paying a departure tax when you leave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I actually travelled overland from Mexico to Belize and was told I had to pay the departure tax (M$1,150/$60) when I crossed the Mexican border. Fortunately, I’d done my research in advance and printed out an itemised receipt of my flight into Mexico. That receipt showed that the departure tax had been included in the flight price, so I was free to skip out on paying it. The 30-odd people on my bus weren’t so lucky.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

A dry bag: If you’re going to be hitting the beaches in Mexico or taking any boat trips, I highly recommend packing a dry bag to take with you. A dry bag has saved me while travelling on so many occasions:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On a kayaking trip from Koh Yao Noi to Koh Nok, in Thailand, a freak wave splashed over me, as well as my camera and phone. Had I not had them in a dry bag, the water damage would have likely destroyed them.On a ferry ride in Thailand, the boat sprung a leak and began to sink. I was able to put my laptop, camera, hard drive, passport, and money in my dry bag, seal it up, and know that they’d stay safe and dry if the worst were to happen.I chartered a yacht in Greece and when mooring in tiny bays, was able to fill my dry bag with my camera, towel, and sunscreen, jump in the sea, and swim to the nearest empty beach without worrying about keeping my belongings dry.I also think dry bags are fantastic for solo travellers on beach days. In French Polynesia, I filled mine with my valuables and took it for a swim with me, rather than having to leave them on my towel while hoping nobody would grab them.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I love all things Sea to Summit, and after trying several of their dry bags out, my favourite is the Ultra-Sil 8L — it’s durable, thin, lightweight, and has never let me down — I’ve been using it for over five years.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A GRAYL water purifier bottle: In countries with unsafe drinking water, I recommend picking up a GRAYL water bottle to save money on drinking while also helping protect the environment. This bottle comes complete with a filter that makes tap water safe to drink — you fill the bottle with water, slide the filter down to the bottom, then drink away. Doing so kills 99.9999% of all viruses, bacteria, and parasites in water and gets rid of any sediment, heavy metals, or weird flavours, making it completely safe to drink. You can drink tap water anywhere in the world with this bottle and not get sick — whether you’re in Mexico, Mozambique, or the Maldives! Trust me — I’ve used it in dozens of countries and never fallen unwell from doing so.;;;;;;;;;

The colour of the water in Isla Mujeres was incredible! I snapped this photo as I was exploring the island by scooter.;;;;;;;;;

My Overall Travel Expenses in Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
I’ve spent seven months travelling in this wonderful country, so I have a whole range of budget breakdowns to share with you. Rather than just sharing my overall expenses, I want to break it down by different regions, as well as the cost of travel with the cost of basing yourself in one spot. ;;;;;;;;;

The following day was set to be the biggest of my life. After five years of planning, saving, and dreaming, I was now mere hours away from setting out to travel the world. This had been my sole focus for the past 2000 days. I’d taken on multiple jobs and worked every spare second I could in order to save up for this trip. I’d moved back in with my parents. I’d turned down the opportunity to get a PhD. I’d bought ugly travel clothes, subjected myself to a ton of vaccines, and spent many 12 hour days breathlessly poring over travel blogs. After counting down for months on end, my departure date had finally arrived.;;;;;;;;;
But I didn’t want to go.;;;;;;;;;
I really didn’t want to go.;;;;;;;;;
And I very nearly didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
Suddenly, I was convinced leaving to travel would be a huge mistake. Now that my departure date was looming, I had to face the fact that this was really going to happen.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t stop thinking about the things that could go wrong.;;;;;;;;;
What if my plane crashes? What if I arrive in Dubrovnik and there aren’t any taxis to take me to my hostel? What if I get to the hostel and they’ve lost my booking? What do you even say when you arrive at a hostel? What if I hate my hostel? What if somebody steals all of my things? What if everyone there looks down on me because I don’t have any travel experience? What if I can’t figure out how to get to my next destination? What if I don’t make any friends? What if I get homesick? What if I get malaria? What if I get lost? What if I get scammed? What if I get robbed? What if I get kidnapped? What if I get raped? What if I get murdered? … What if after all of this planning, I discover I don’t like travel?;;;;;;;;;
I get a lot of emails from people telling me I’m brave. I guess back then, with all of those irrational fears bouncing around in my head, I kind of was. I kind of am. But at the time, I felt anything but courageous. I felt like a fraud. I felt ill-equipped. I felt as though I’d most likely be back home within a week.;;;;;;;;;
I get a lot of emails from people telling me they wish they were as brave I am, and I guess I’m writing this post for them. Because leaving your comfort zone and everything you’ve ever known can be really freaking scary. A lot of travel bloggers make it sound easy, like they just packed their bags, hopped on a plane, and immediately began living the dream. Maybe for them it was that easy. But for me, it wasn’t.;;;;;;;;;
And that means that if I can find the courage to travel, you most likely can, too.;;;;;;;;;

A very pale Lauren with her brand new backpack;;;;;;;;;
And if I’m being honest, if I hadn’t started Never Ending Footsteps, I’m not sure I would have left.;;;;;;;;;
I’d spent the past six months counting down to this trip online, sharing why I wanted to travel, what I hoped to gain from it, where I was dreaming of visiting. On that day before my departure date, my social media feeds were full of people wishing me luck and cheering me on. How could I then tell everyone I’d chickened out at the last minute?;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve read How Not to Travel the World, you’ll know the first chapter opens with me oversleeping and discovering I had mere minutes to pack my bag and leave. The reason why someone who’d planned out every single step of their trip hadn’t managed to fill their backpack yet? Because I wasn’t planning on even going.;;;;;;;;;
But I left anyway. I knew that if I didn’t, I most likely would end up spending the rest of my life wondering what could have been. I didn’t want my brain to be filled with regrets, so I forced myself onto the plane and into my new life, telling myself that if I hated it, I was only a plane ride away from home.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
You know how the next chapter of my story unfolds: travel was incredible for me. It was transformative. It changed my life, and me, for the better.;;;;;;;;;
That decision to get on the plane was the best I’ve ever made.;;;;;;;;;
But that doesn’t mean I’ve lost my travel nerves.;;;;;;;;;
At the airport on the morning of my trip. I probably shouldn’t have stopped to take a photo, because I nearly ended up missing my flight.;;;;;;;;;
I Almost Didn’t Go to Southeast Asia;;;;;;;;;
I was three months into my trip, had spent time hopping around Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, but Southeast Asia intimidated me. It had been the one place I’d fantasised about the most when I’d started travelling and I’d built it up in my mind as this paradise I’d fall in love with.;;;;;;;;;
So far, though, my trip hadn’t been going as smoothly as I might have hoped. <– This is an understatement. China had been a disaster from start to finish, full of scams and aggression, where someone spat in my hair and the locals fought to take advantage of me. I got lost all the time, I had never-ending stomach cramps, and the pollution had given me what felt like a sinus infection.;;;;;;;;;
I’d been so excited to visit China, then practically hated every moment I’d spent in the country. I was exhausted, I was unwell, and I was over travel.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The thought of going to Southeast Asia and having similarly awful experiences was enough to have me searching for flights home. I was worried it wouldn’t be as great as I was hoping. I was worried the party scene would be too intense and my fellow backpackers would think I was boring. I was worried I wouldn’t make friends. I was worried I’d get dengue or rabies or cholera. I was worried I wouldn’t have the same awesome-sounding experiences I’d read about in other travel blogs.;;;;;;;;;
Of course, I LOVED Southeast Asia and it ended up being my favourite region in the world.;;;;;;;;;
I Almost Didn’t Go to Morocco;;;;;;;;;
I flew from Vienna to Barcelona, and then during my layover at the airport, it hit me that I was hours away from taking my first steps in a brand new continent. I’d done my research beforehand and read my fair share of horror stories online about solo female travellers in Morocco experiencing nothing but harassment. I thought I could handle it when I was booking my flight, but I was suddenly having second thoughts.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was so nervous about flying to Marrakech that I walked through to the departures hall in Barcelona’s airport and started scanning the boards for flights to London. I was so close to cancelling my trip and heading home for a few weeks instead.;;;;;;;;;
I was concerned that Morocco would shove me too far out of my comfort zone. That I’d be sexually assaulted by the men. That the public transport would be unsafe. That I’d be mugged, or be a victim of a scam. That I wouldn’t like the food and would get food poisoning. That I wouldn’t be able to find a tour operator to take me to the Sahara Desert. That I wouldn’t make any friends (this is always a concern of mine).;;;;;;;;;
Morocco was as challenging as I’d expected before arriving, but to my great surprise, it still ended up as one of my favourite countries. I’m so glad I went.;;;;;;;;;
I Almost Didn’t Go to the South Pacific;;;;;;;;;
I was having a panic attack in the bathroom of Dave’s parents’ home in New Zealand. In three days’ time, I was supposed to be boarding a flight to the Cook Islands and I was on the verge of cancelling.;;;;;;;;;
It had been a challenging year for me, and my anxiety disorder that had remained dormant for the first four years of my travels had unexpectedly reared its head.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The last time I’d experienced panic attacks so close to the departure date of a trip was when I was about to spend a month in the Seychelles, Mauritius, and the Maldives.;;;;;;;;;
I’d cancelled that trip, and in doing so, had calmed my anxiety for a while.;;;;;;;;;
Was I supposed to cancel this trip, too? I was close to deciding to do exactly that.;;;;;;;;;
I was worried I’d have a panic attack in the Cook Islands. That it would happen in a dorm room and everyone would think I was insane. That my anxiety would get worse once I left Dave’s side. That my anxiety would get so bad that I’d struggle to eat. That it would be full of honeymooning couples and I’d spend the entire trip alone. That I wouldn’t be able to communicate with anyone in French Polynesia. That people don’t talk about visiting Bora Bora on a budget because it’s awful to do so.;;;;;;;;;
My trip to the South Pacific actually helped to massively improve my anxiety! Although I experienced some struggles, I’m still glad I visited.;;;;;;;;;
You’re starting to see a pattern, right?;;;;;;;;;
I freak out about an upcoming trip, I think about cancelling it, I push myself to go anyway, and everything works out for the best.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So eventually, you’d think, I’d stop panicking so much. That I’d realise things often work out and that even when they don’t, I’ll never regret taking a trip.;;;;;;;;;
But my brain doesn’t work like that.;;;;;;;;;
Even though it’s entirely true that I’ve yet to regret taking any of my trips.;;;;;;;;;
It’s About Fear of the Unknown;;;;;;;;;
Every single time I think about cancelling a trip, it’s to a destination I’ve never been to before.;;;;;;;;;
I wanted to cancel my trip to Southeast Asia because I was scared I wouldn’t like it.;;;;;;;;;
I wanted to cancel my trip to Morocco because I was scared it would be too intimidating;;;;;;;;;
I wanted to cancel my trip to the South Pacific because I was scared I wasn’t strong enough to handle it.;;;;;;;;;
Now, if I was to plan a trip to any of those places, I wouldn’t dream of cancelling it at the last minute! I’ve been there, I know what to expect, and I know I love it. It’s no longer unknown, so I no longer have that fear.;;;;;;;;;
Nice from above;;;;;;;;;
I’m embarrassed to admit this, but my summer trip around Europe scared me. I thought about cancelling it, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

I was nervous to visit Paris.;;;;;;;;;
Paris! ;;;;;;;;;
I’ve been to almost every country in Europe at this point, and I was scared to go to Paris? Yup. I had no idea what to expect. I was worried I’d hate it, I’d get lost, I’d be raped, I’d be murdered.;;;;;;;;;
I was nervous about Venice. Berlin. Luxembourg. Nice. Monaco. Andorra.;;;;;;;;;
These are all easy places to visit. They’re safe. They’re familiar. They’re not hugely different from any other European city. As a European who has seen so much of Europe, I shouldn’t have been intimidated by them.;;;;;;;;;
Anxiety can do some wild things to your brain.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Sometimes I’ve given into my fear of the unknown and cancelled my trips.;;;;;;;;;
I was supposed to go to Palau after my trip to the Philippines;;;;;;;;;
I was supposed to go to India after my trip to Sri Lanka.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was supposed to go to Malta after my trip to Morocco.;;;;;;;;;
I was supposed to go to Sierra Leone this month, but cancelled it because I’m still nervous about travelling alone to African countries.;;;;;;;;;
It’s a hard question to face, but when I think about whether I regret cancelling these trips, the answer is almost always mostly-sort-of-yes. It’s tough, though, because I know I made the right decision for me at the time. But now? Yeah, there’s definitely a bit of regret and guilt surrounding my decision to give in to fear.;;;;;;;;;
After all, I’ve never regretted taking a trip.;;;;;;;;;
If I was a terracotta warrior, I would feel no fear.;;;;;;;;;
Yesterday, I booked a solo trip to Mozambique for early next year.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve wanted to go to Mozambique for forever, so to score return flights from Lisbon for around $250 was basically my ultimate dream come true.;;;;;;;;;
But I’ve never been to a Southern African country before, so I have no idea what to expect. I’m fearful about my safety, about logistics, about how I’ll get around, about what the country will be like, about whether I’ll make friends. I’m massively intimidated about going there.;;;;;;;;;
Since booking my flight twelve hours ago, I’ve thought multiple times about cancelling.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
The Travel Nerves Are Always With Me;;;;;;;;;
That’s what I’ve learned.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve come to discover that every time I book a flight to a place I’ve never visited before, it’s inevitable that I’ll want to cancel it. That I’ll be nervous up until the moment I arrive, no matter how safe and well-visited the country might be.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve learned to live with it and to expect it, but there are several things I do to minimise those nerves and ensure I actually step on the plane.;;;;;;;;;
I think about whether I’d regret not going: Knowing that I could end up regretting my decision to not going on a trip is often what pushes me to get on the plane. I really don’t want to be someone with regrets, and who spends all of their time wishing they’d done something when they’d had the chance. Whenever I think about cancelling my trip, the fear that I’ll end up wishing I hadn’t is what makes me go.;;;;;;;;;
I remind myself I can stop whenever I want: If you can afford to take a trip, you can most likely afford to cut it short and leave. While I’ve rarely done this, just knowing that I have the option to go somewhere else if I hate a particularly place sets my mind at ease.;;;;;;;;;
I meticulously plan my first few days in the country: One of the easiest ways to beat fear of the unknown is to research your ass off about a place until it almost feels like you’ve been there before. Look at photos online, watch vlogs of people exploring the destination on Youtube, buy guidebooks, and book your first few days in advance. I’ll usually hand in my hardcore traveler card at immigration and take a taxi to my hostel, because I know it gives me one less thing to worry about. I’ll stay in the best reviewed hostel or budget hotel in the city. I’ll put together an itinerary for my first couple of days; maybe sign up for a tour to keep myself busy. By the time I come to leave, I’ll have a much better idea of what to expect and won’t feel as nervous.;;;;;;;;
I listen to Headspace in the weeks leading up to my departure: I feel as though I mention Headspace in practically every single one of my posts these days, but it’s so good at calming travel nerves and fears! I’ll meditate each morning and evening in the run-up to a trip to put me in a much better, um, headspace.;;;;;;;;;
I run through previous trips in my mind: As I mentioned above, I’ve never, ever come to regret taking a trip, so when I start thinking about cancelling a future one, I always remind myself that I’ve felt this way dozens of times before.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Everything I’d read about Aitutaki cited a lagoon cruise as the number one thing to do on the island, but I get seasick and I don’t like organised tours and seawater brings me out in a rash and snorkelling gives me a headache. I decided to skip it because why would I pay to make myself feel terrible?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Like flipping a coin and discovering what you wanted all along, my decision left me flooded with guilt. I changed my mind again and I’m so glad I did.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My day spent exploring the Aitutaki’s lagoon was one of my best ever.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To say that the lagoon is important to Aitutaki would be a vast understatement. Check out this photo of it from above:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yep: the lagoon is more than three times the size of the island, so if you remain on land, you’re only seeing a small portion of what makes Aitutaki so special. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And after having spent four days exploring the island, I can firmly say that you’ll be missing out on the best aspects of Aitutaki by not getting your feet wet. Take a lagoon cruise. It’s so worth it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our Itinerary;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I joined the full-day cruise offered by Teking Tours, which takes you to three snorkelling spots and four motus (islets in Polynesia). I opted for Teking because the groups are small (no more than ten people to a boat) and because a percentage of my fee would be donated towards helping conserve and protect the lagoon. Additionally, the boat is much smaller than other tours’ so you’re able to access the better snorkelling spots away from the crowds.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Mornings on the water are spent around all things giant: the first stop involves snorkelling alongside giant trevallies and Napoleon wrasses around an old shipwreck, and the second is spent diving down to take a closer look at hundreds of giant clams. The latter grow to somewhere around six feet in length and spending time around them was both joyful and terrifying.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Lunches on group tours are uniformly terrible in my experience, which is why I was so thrilled with Teking’s offerings. Fresh fish barbecue with many tuna steaks, lots of rice, potato salad, and tons of fresh fruit. It was all delicious and the best meal I had in the Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
More snorkelling is on the agenda for the afternoon, with a whole cluster of purple coral surrounding the next stopping point. The coral here is so vibrant that many of the experienced divers on my trip claimed it to be some of the best they’ve seen.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The trip is rounded off on a high, when you’re dropped off on a sand bar and instructed to walk several hundred metres through calf-deep water to One Foot Island, where there’s a surprise in store for you.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how my tour went!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Snorkelling a Shipwreck Surrounded by Giant Trevallies;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I clambered on to the boat from southern shore of Aitutaki and we set sail for paradise.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Within seconds of the engine juddering to life, I reached for my camera because the colour of the lagoon was already blowing my mind. Our first stop was to the insanely gorgeous Honeymoon island to drop off our lunch for later. It was on this short trip that I took the photo I’ve shared in every post I’ve written about the Cook Islands so far. But have you ever seen anything closer to paradise than this before?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We made our way to a nearby shipwreck, then were directed to remove all of our jewellery so the trevallies wouldn’t attempt to gobble it (or us). Gulp.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’m not a big snorkelling person, so it takes a lot to impress me when my face is in the water. This did. For the hour I spent swimming around, I was surrounded by thousands of colourful fish, I spotted brightly coloured starfish for the first time in my life, I saw the most colourful coral ever, and I was terrified of the giant trevallies. While they were harmless and left us alone, I couldn’t help but notice their teeth as they glided by.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Swimming through a shipwreck was a particular highlight, as I didn’t think I’d ever get to do so without going diving. This particular wreck — the Alexander — was a freighter that used to bring cargo to the island, until it sunk in the 1930s. These days, it’s teeming with sealife and covered in barnacles.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Giant Clams are Seriously Giant;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When we were told we were going to see giant clams, I pictured a foot-long shell in my head and shuddered. Nope! These giant clams were well over three feet in length and there were hundreds of them scattered across the ocean floor. They were vibrant, colourful, and seriously wild to see up close.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our boat dropped us off next to a cluster of several dozen of them and our captain gave us instructions to swim to a nearby sand bar. We spent the next hour spotting colourful fish, snapping photos of the coral, and marvelling at how psychedelic the insides of the clams were.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Shouldn’t Have Skipped the Purple Coral;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our final snorkelling stop of the day was all about the purple coral. I skipped it, because my ill-fitting snorkelling mask had given me a pounding headache and I couldn’t face swallowing even more seawater. I’m such a failure at snorkelling! Instead, I stayed on the boat and chatted with the crew about what it was like growing up on Aitutaki, and the changes they’d witnessed as tourism increased.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But when I do a Google Image search for Aitutaki purple coral, I find a ton of photos taken by people on Teking Tours and it looks ridiculously beautiful.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One Foot Island is the Highlight;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Whoa,” I gasped, as I leapt off the boat and onto the sand bar. “Wow.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Wow,” someone else echoed as they jumped after me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Wow!” somebody else exclaimed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Our group descended onto the soft sand and said our wows in shellshocked wonder. This was the most spectacular sight I’d ever seen, leaving me feeling as though I was splashing my way through a photoshopped travel brochure.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Walk over to One Foot Island,” our captain called out to us, motioning to a small island a couple of hundred metres away. “I’ll meet you there.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It must have taken us half an hour to splash our way across that short distance because we couldn’t stop taking posing and taking photos. I couldn’t believe this place was real.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I can’t believe I had a big smear on the middle of my camera lens for my entire time on One Foot Island!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Moment to Sit and Contemplate;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On One Foot Island island, we were given an hour to do whatever we wanted. Most people ran directly into the ocean to snorkel with a passing fever of stingrays, but I decided to stay on the beach instead, burying my feet in the sand.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t stop blinking. Ahead of me was bright white sand, untouched jungle, a cyan-blue lagoon filled with sea life. I kept blinking because I was certain I was dreaming, and because I thought that if I did it enough times, I’d be able to capture how incredible it felt to be sitting there so I could revisit it in the future.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I had just achieved my greatest travel goal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A smile spread across my face. One that left my jaw aching for the rest of the day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Let’s Talk About My Passport…;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s the thing: when I was researching cruises, I read a lot of excited reports about how you could get your passport stamped while you’re on One Foot Island, home to the world’s smallest post office. And it was tiny. It was essentially a tiny shack on the beach, where its only purpose is to stamp tourists’ passports.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Anyway, I dutifully shoved my passport into my bag when I left my guesthouse, and after we arrived on the island, handed it off to be stamped.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And guys. Um, I kind of hate it. Look at the size of that thing! I have a giant foot in my passport! It’s big and ugly and conspicuous and I’m convinced it’s going to result in me not being let into a country somewhere down the line. Ugh!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And Then the Boat Broke Down;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I can’t write about my trip without mentioning that our boat broke down. Given my string of bad luck in the Cook Islands, the news that we were stranded in the middle of lagoon produced little more than a knowing smile from me. Of course our boat had broken down!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was somewhere between one and two hours before another boat came out to rescue us. And despite the rocking boat and the encroaching sunburn, there were far worse places to be stranded. We spent our time paddling in the knee-deep water that surrounded us and then hiding under towels to protect our skin.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t the best end to a beautiful day, but the staff were apologetic and I get that these things happen.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Final Treat;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We arrived back on dry land as the sun was starting to set, salty and sweaty, and desperate for a cold shower. Teking, the tour company owner, met us off the boat to apologise for our other one breaking down, then made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. Rather than taking the minivan back with the rest of the group, he could drive me back to my guesthouse on the back of his motorbike. Just another benefit of being a solo traveller!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I hopped on the back and grinned — motorbikes make me happy. Teking asked how much I’d seen of the island and, when I told him I’d cycled around the shoreline but hadn’t made it to any of the viewpoints, he wheeled the bike around and drove me up the nearest mountain. We stopped at the main viewpoint, and I took a ton of photos, and then Teking took me to his favourite spot on the island — one that few people know about.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On the way back to the guesthouse, we chatted about his life in the Cook Islands: why he decided to start a tour company, his family, his tentative plans to move to Honeymoon Island, and more. I was thrilled to gain a local’s insight into Cook Island life, and exploring places I wouldn’t have otherwise seen was the icing on the cake. The perfect end to a mostly-perfect day!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Takeaway: This Was One of the Best Experiences I’ve Ever Had;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s no doubt about it: this was a travel highlight that’ll stay with me for a long time. I’d rank it in the top ten experiences of my travels over the past ten years, even with the boat breaking down and my chronic seasickness. That should tell you how good it was!;;;;;;;;;

If you’re planning a trip to the Cook Islands, you have to go to Aitutaki, and you have to go on a lagoon cruise. I’m not sure I’ll ever visit anywhere more beautiful in my life and I can’t recommend it enough!;;;;;;;;;

Essential Information;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
"I booked through Teking Tours, where a full day cruise comes in at 110 NZD (75 USD). I thought it offered fantastic value for money and would spend it again in a heartbeat!I was the only solo woman on the boat. Like my time throughout the Cook Islands, I was the lone backpacker in a crowd of loved-up couples and families. On my boat, there was a British couple on a round-the-world honeymoon, a French family with a kid, and a British family with two teenagers.Bring water or cash with you: I assumed that water would be provided on board, but it was only available for $4 a bottle. I didn’t bring any money with me because I didn’t think I’d have anything to spend it on and ended up dehydrated by the end of the tour. Don’t wear any jewellery: Giant trevallies are seriously attracted to jewellery, so you won’t want to wear any for the tour. I kept my belly bar in and was fine, but one of the women in my tour group had a trevally circling her after she left her wedding ring on.Re-apply sunscreen every hour: I applied my SPF50 sunscreen before the trip and after every snorkelling stop and still ended up sunburnt. The sun is strong in the Cook Islands, especially if you’re spending a full day out on the lagoon. It’s worth investing in a dry bag if you don’t already have one: After having my boat take on a hole in Koh Lipe and almost sink, I don’t go anywhere near water without my dry bag. On the cruise, I kept my camera, clothes, GoPro, and passport inside, safe in the knowledge that none of them would get wet. Bonus: if you seal it with air inside, the bag floats, so if your stuff happens to fall overboard, you won’t lose everything. I use and recommend this one from Sea to Summit. I’ve used it for four years and it’s still going strong!If you want to visit Aitutaki on a budget, I recommend staying at Gina’s Garden Lodges. I tried out several inexpensive accommodation options on the island and this was by far the best. For $50 a night, I stayed in a garden bungalow that sleeps five, with a decent kitchen, and a free airport transfer.""";;;;;;;;;

Twenty minutes into our drive from New Orleans to Slidell, I’d decided to research what a swamp actually was, and it sounded boring.;;;;;;;;;
After five years of exploring the world, I’ve been lucky to experience many extremes of nature: camping in the Sahara Desert, hiking across glaciers in New Zealand, riding in a helicopter over an active volcano in Hawaii, swimming in tropical lagoons in Bora Bora, marvelling at a giant meteor crater in Arizona.;;;;;;;;;
…And taking a cruise across a swamp?;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t have quite the same ring to it.;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t sound quite as exciting or adventurous as other things I’d done.;;;;;;;;;
Quite frankly, it sounded kind of smelly.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Fun fact: swamps don’t smell. Or at least, this one didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t know why I thought it would. I’ve always imagined swamps as these stinky sulphur mud pools with bubbling gases emerging from the surface and alligators laying inches away in wait.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out only some of them are like that, because this trip couldn’t have been further from that image in my mind. And you know what? Swamps totally deserve a place on my list of travel adventures! They’re strangely beautiful, fascinating places, with a whole host of dangerous wildlife to panic about calmly observe.;;;;;;;;;
And speaking of wildlife, you know that famous photo of a, um, sasquatch? That was taken at Honey Island Swamp, where my family and I would be spending the afternoon.;;;;;;;;;
Maybe it wouldn’t be quite so boring after all.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We’d signed up for a trip with Dr Wagner’s Honey Island Swamp Tours, drawn in by their great reviews, reasonable prices ($48 each for a two-hour-long tour with a pickup from New Orleans; $23 without the pickup), the fact they only hire expert guides native to South Louisiana, and their small boats, which would enable us to travel down narrow backwater channels and get up close and personal with the wildlife.;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Not necessarily a good thing for someone with as much of a nervous disposition as me.;;;;;;;;;
But let’s rewind to the beginning of the tour.;;;;;;;;;
Upon arriving at Slidell, we clambered into our flat-bottomed boat and roared off down the Pearl River at far higher speeds than said boat looked capable of. We had just two hours on the water, so were kicking off our journey by powering towards the swampy backrivers.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was time to start hunting for ‘gators.;;;;;;;;;
Once we reached the shallows, our guide cut the engine and we floated in silence, every breath held as we watched and waited for something terrifying to emerge from the chocolate-brown depths.;;;;;;;;;
“Hereeee, gator gator gator,” our driver called in an eerie tone, waving a stick above the water before letting out a high-pitched shriek in an attempt to draw the predators to the surface.;;;;;;;;;
Silence descended once more as we waited, drifting directionless between tupelo trees, eyes peeled, fingers tense on camera shutters.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“That’s one!” Our guide broke the silence and thrust his finger towards a patch of water.;;;;;;;;;
As the sound of clicking cameras filled the air, I chastised myself for forgetting to put in my contact lenses.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t see a thing.;;;;;;;;;
Still, I pointed my camera in the direction of Dave’s and held down my shutter for several seconds, hoping I’d managed to focus on the baby alligator that everyone was murmuring about.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I ended up with a dozen photos of branches, so here’s the much better photo Dave managed to capture of our first alligator sighting.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There was little movement in this area of the swamp, so when we heard word of a ten-foot-long spotting from another guide, we restarted the engine and set off racing down the river once more.;;;;;;;;;
Our next stop involved passing through a canal lined with expansive houses and manicured gardens, which wasn’t necessarily what I was expecting to see on the bayou, but hey, if you can afford to live to anywhere, why not choose somewhere offbeat and isolated?;;;;;;;;;
On this occasion, though, I have to admit that I wasn’t nudging Dave at the sight of a pretty home and chattering about how we’d have a place like that one day.;;;;;;;;;
No, I don’t think I could ever leave the house if my backyard regularly entertained ten-foot-long guests that would chew up a Lauren for an appetiser.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I don’t usually have much luck on animal-spotting adventures. I’ve lost count of the number of whale watching tours I’ve reluctantly signed up for, only to end up seeing nothing but my breakfast regurgitated into the ocean.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and there was that particular experience in Hawaii where an enormous humpback whale emerged from the water directly beside our boat, but I’d felt too nauseated to even raise my head to check it out.;;;;;;;;;
So to come on a tour like this and be surrounded by wildlife at every turn was an unexpected delight. Especially as we were visiting during low season for alligator-spotting and there had been floods in recent weeks, sending away many of the animals.;;;;;;;;;
I spotted a vibrant dragonfly hanging out on Dave’s knee.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spotted a snake slithering along a branch.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And another snake.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And another snake.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that was our time on the swamp! Would I recommend it?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Absolutely!;;;;;;;;;
Visiting Honey Island Swamps ranks highly as one of the best things I’ve done this year, and I wouldn’t hesitate to take another trip to the bayou in the future. Getting up close and personal with the alligators and snakes made for a fun-filled afternoon, and learning that a swamp was so much cooler than I expected it to be was even better.;;;;;;;;;

Over the past 12 months, I travelled across eighteen countries; seven of them new. I spent time in 62 cities and slept in 35 beds. I took 15 flights and travelled 24,613 miles. I spent $20,417.83.;;;;;;;;
You could say it’s been the best year of my life; I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have received so many amazing opportunities. I wrote a book! It sold out its first print run in three months! The vast majority of the reviews have been positive! I’m a published author and it still feels incredible. This year, I lived in Spain for several months. I ran my first 5k race. I visited the Baltics, a brand new region of Europe for me. I explored Cornwall and saw for myself that there’s more to England than my London bubble. I stayed in an Italian village with a permanent population of two. I took a ferry to Finland on a whim. I spent several nights floating on a river in the jungles of Cambodia. I ate everything in Taiwan. And Vietnam. And Spain. And Italy.;;;;;;;;
And at the same time, I can’t deny this year has included some of the biggest challenges I’ve ever faced. Mental breakdowns. Panic attacks. Self-doubt. Cancelled trips. Bedbugs. Allergic reactions. Letting down friends. Losing my passport. Forgetting to apply for visas. I started the year in one of the darkest periods of my life, but end it at one of my strongest. Those terrible experiences were necessary for me to reassess my life and make the changes I’d been putting off for a while.;;;;;;;;;
This was my 2015!;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top-left: delicious pulled pork sandwich in Brixton; buying bread at Borough Market in London; the view of the Alhambra from close to our apartment; and Granada’s beautiful cathedral.;;;;;;

I rang in the new year in London, playing Cards Against Humanity and drinking wine with friends. We heard Big Ben strike twelve, then promptly fell asleep.;;;;;;;;;

Dave and I spent a full month living in Brixton, the London neighbourhood that had me seriously considering making my the place I grew up a long-term base. It was a vibrant, busy area with tons of character, incredible food, and cosy pubs for devouring roast dinners. I spent my time showing Dave my favourite London haunts, before getting to work on the first draft of my manuscript for How Not to Travel the World.;;;;;;;;;
Mid-way through the month, I packed up my things and flew to Granada, ready to settle down. I had a book to write and this southern Spanish city sounded like the perfect place to do so.;;;;;;;;;
Clockwise from top left: A rare snowy day from my bedroom window in Granada; views of the Albaycin from my apartment; looking down on the Alhambra from my favourite hike in the city; a standard paella lunch.;;;;;;
February;;;;;;;;;
As February rolled around, I found myself slipping into a pit of despair. I’m not sure I even left my apartment once this month. 18 hour work days were the name of the game here, and the less said about those the better.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
March;;;;;;;;;
Handing in the first draft of my manuscript brought billowing waves of relief to my life and I celebrated the milestone with a trip to Ronda. This beautiful cliffside city remains one of the most spectacular places I’ve ever visited and I spent much of my time gawping into the giant chasm that separates the old town from the new.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Back in Granada, I welcomed the arrival of my parents just as I started work on the structural edit of my book. For the first time in many months, though, I chose to prioritise the people I love, closing my laptop and spending a blissful few days getting to know the city I’d called home for three months. We visited the beautiful Alhambra, stuffed our faces with tapas, got tipsy on tinto de verano, and hiked through the hills surrounding the city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
April;;;;;;;;;
The majority of April was spent working on edits, and towards the end of the month, I waved goodbye to Spain. I don’t doubt I would have fallen deeply in love with Granada if I’d had the time to get to know it, but by the time I left, it held little but bad memories for me. I needed to move on.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
My first real travel destination of the year was the Netherlands and I was eager to see it in a different light to my previous visits. So, unlike most tourists, we landed in Amsterdam and left on the first train out of there. Utrecht was our first port of call and I was thrilled to be Dutching it up by staying on a houseboat! Our time was spent drinking wine on the terrace, wandering through the pretty old town, and eating delicious Greek food. And bitterbollen, of course — my favourite!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
May;;;;;;;;;
Our explorations of the Netherlands continued into May. From Utrecht, we travelled south to Leiden to catch the famous tulips on display, and found a bustling university city with a lively bar scene alongside the river. I liked it a lot.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The highlight of the trip, though, would have to be Maastricht. It’s located way down in the south of the country, a few kilometres from the Belgian and German borders and feels so different to the rest of the Netherlands: the architecture, the food, the culture — I felt like I was in a new country! It was in Maastricht that I momentarily lost my mind and signed up for a running tour — this coming from someone who hadn’t walked more than about 30 metres during the first three months of the year and had never been a runner. Somehow, I survived and it was some of the most fun I’ve had all year!;;;;;;;;;
The final stop on our Netherlands tour was The Hague, which was interesting enough, and I enjoyed going to the Escher museum to blink at confusing staircases, but there was nothing I really fell in love with.;;;;;;;;;
When we arrived back in Amsterdam, the final draft of my book landed in my inbox and I had exactly one week to go through the final-final-final edits. I needed to give it my full attention, so I booked a cheap flight back to London and worked solely on it for one last time.;;;;;;;;;
To celebrate finishing, I booked a spur-of-the-moment trip to Norway and landed in Oslo for my first taste of Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
June;;;;;;;;;
June was another action-packed month of travel! It was also a lesson in managing travel expectations — I fell in hard in love with Oslo, a place I had been fully expecting to be a boring capital city, and was disappointed in Bergen, a city I was certain would be one of my travel highlights. One thing is for certain, though: Norway is a beautiful (and crazy-expensive!) country that is best seen when it isn’t raining. Sadly, the fjord trip I took ended up being all about the grey drizzle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I flew home shortly afterwards to spend my birthday with my family and participate in my first 5k colour obstacle run! Again, I must have lost my mind. I did disastrously, but had so much fun.;;;;;;;;;
The final half of the month was spent road tripping around one of my favourite new regions of the world: Cornwall! Spectacular beaches you’d never believe were in the U.K., stunning countryside, staying in a shepherd’s hut and a yurt, and some of the best food I’ve ever eaten. Guys, the food. It was an indulgent trip in the best possible way and I can’t wait to return next year.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
July;;;;;;;;;
July has to be one of my busiest travel months yet! With the euphoria of a book under my belt and out of the way, I was determined to get back my travel roots and backpack solo around the Baltics in the style I used to. Side note! Somebody commented in my recent reader survey that I sometimes seem to look down on backpackers — not true! I travel with a backpack! I am a backpacker! I use backpacker, traveller, and tourist interchangeably as they’re/we’re all the same to me.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
First stop: Riga, where I ate incredible Latvian garlic bread, signed up for fun walking tours, fell in love with Black Balsam, had a girl throw up in my dorm room, and took hundreds of photos of the colourful architecture.;;;;;;;;;
Next: Tallinn, one of the prettiest cities I’ve visited; being there was like being in a fairytale. Then somebody threw up in the bed above mine, but it was okay because my bed had bed bugs. Worst hostel experience ever? I think so.;;;;;;;;
In a fit of madness, rage, and spontaneity, I cancelled the rest of my stay in Tallinn, packed my backpack, and bought a ticket for the next ferry out of Estonia. In Helsinki, I treated myself to a stay in the highest-rated hotel in the city, ate beautiful meals, and spent a traumatising 24 hours power-washing and blow drying every single item in my backpack.;;;;;;;;;
I travelled to Stockholm next, opting to stay in the hipster Hornstull neighbourhood. It reminded me of Shoreditch in London, full of coffee shops, beards, live music, and street food.;;;;;;;;;
Back to the Baltics! I headed to Vilnius next and found a beautiful city of grand architecture and big black clouds. Vilnius was probably the place I knew least about in the Baltics and ended up being one of my favourites, even with all the rain.;;;;;;;;;
Are you tired yet? Next up was my first visit to Poland! In Warsaw, I booked an apartment in the old Jewish Quarter and found it fascinating yet sobering to wander streets that were steeped in tragic history. My time in Warsaw was frustratingly short — I was exhausted from too much travel and Dave’s photos from Porto, where he was currently holed up, convinced me to book a flight to see him.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
In Porto, I spent a week immersing myself in beaches, architecture, and delicious food. I took a day trip to the Douro Valley and discovered that port is my favourite drink in the world, and I took a quirky walking tour of the abandoned buildings in the city.;;;;;;;;;
At the end of July, I boarded a bus to Madrid, ready to sit still for six weeks. I had a book to launch and I needed to stop moving.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
August;;;;;;;;;
Madrid was the perfect place to spend six weeks of summer and I quickly fell in love with the laidback lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;
Mid-month, I launched How Not to Travel the World and promptly had a nervous breakdown. It was terrifying to have something I’d poured my heart and soul into now out into the world for anyone to read, yet I was bursting with pride at having achieved something so monumental. It was an odd few days full of celebrations and insecurity.;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I flew out to Ljubljana, my favourite European city, to get me away from Goodreads and Amazon. We met up with my parents who were road tripping around the region for their summer holiday and I made it my mission to show them why Ljubljana is so special. There were no other people in the world I’d rather have spent my big launch week with, and this wonderful trip was filled with wine, pizza, and many happy tears.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My trip to Slovenia was sandwiched between two stints in Italy, both of which showed me I’d been hugely missing out by passing over it for the past four years. Verona was beautiful, but the highlight had to be our stay in Lake Como. We met up with a couple of Dave’s Italian friends, who he had met on a bus in Laos seven-odd years ago. After their travels, they’d opened a restaurant in the tiny village of Piazzaga, overlooking Lake Como. And when I say tiny, I mean tiny. It’s only accessible by a horrifying jeep journey over a rocky path that barely fits all four wheels or a 45 minute walk uphill by foot. It has a permanent population of two.;;;;;;;;;
And I can’t even begin to describe how good the meals were there. Everything was so fresh and sourced from about a few metre radius. The pasta! The tomatoes! The meat! Oh my godddddd!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
September;;;;;;;;;
My time in Madrid drew to a close at the start of September and it was time for me to face some harsh truths. The stress of writing a 90,000-word book in three months had destroyed my mental health and I had been ignoring it for months. I’d hoped I could jump straight from finishing it to travelling how I used to — I run a travel blog after all — this is my career! But it had been making me unwell.;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
September was when I pushed the reset button and took a month for myself. I turned off my laptop and I stopped using social media. I ate healthily, I worked out, I read books, and I cultivated new interests. Stopping was the best thing I’ve ever done for myself and I hope to hit to continue hitting that reset button every few years in the future.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
October;;;;;;;;;
I hit the ground running in October, fully refreshed and ready to start travelling again. After reuniting with Dave in Madrid after he had finished walking the Camino, we made our way to Southeast Asia for the winter.;;;;;;;;;
These days, I’m starting to notice that much of my travels are based around where my friends are, so after hearing that some of my buddies were going to be in Bangkok for a couple of weeks, we booked an apartment in their neighbourhood and spent the next ten days stuffing our face with Thai food.;;;;;;;;;
I missed Dave’s birthday while he was on the Camino, so threw a belated celebration in Cambodia for him instead. Those action-packed 10 days were all about travelling in luxury in one of our favourite countries. We slept in a floating resort on the Tatai river, re-visited Kampot to snack on our favourite Kampot peppers and eat mashed potatoes, returned to our beloved Otres Beach, and hit up Siem Reap to visit the Angkor temples that aren’t on the tourist trail.;;;;;;;;;

We rounded off the month in Vietnam with my first visit to Hanoi. Dave’s parents flew out to visit us for this part of our trip, and we had so much fun showing them around the chaotic north and laidback Hoi An.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
November;;;;;;;;;
I ended my time in Vietnam with a whirlwind visit to Saigon, a place I’m fortunate to have spent several months living in in the past. This time, I wasn’t so lucky and instead, we had an action-packed two days showing Dave’s parents our favourite restaurants and smoothie haunts.;;;;;;;;;
Next stop: Taipei! This city is one of my favourites in the world — one of the first I fell in love with on this trip, and the first city in Asia I ever visited. I loved having an entire month to spend here and our quality of life was so high! Basing ourselves in the Xinye district, we ate our way around the neighbourhood and found ourselves in a fantastic area for digital nomads. We even found a coffee shop that was giving away 3 cent cheesecake for every drink you bought!;;;;;;;;;

December;;;;;;;;;
As December rolled around, I flew to Melbourne for three weeks of coffee shop hopping and Vegemite eating. Last time I visited Melbourne, I spent the majority of my time living in the suburbs, but this time around, I’m hanging out in hipster Fitzroy.;;;;;;;;;
And because I’m writing this post a little before the end of December, I can tell you I’ll be spending the next couple of weeks catching up on work, catching up with friends, and wandering blissfully around one of Dave’s former homes.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll be rounding off the year in beautiful New Zealand, and hiking the Kepler track, one the country’s Great Walks, and doing my best to start 2016 on a high rather than a broken ankle.;;;;;;;;;

I was toying with the idea of long-term travel and felt as though the entire world had suddenly opened up to me. I grabbed a pen and notepad, pulled up a map of the world, and began to scribble down a list of the destinations I most wanted to visit.";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After weeks of research, the place I had placed right at the top of my wish list was the Cook Islands. From my research, it looked like paradise and I was desperate to visit.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It may have taken me over four years of full-time travel to get there, but man, was it worth the wait! Here’s what it’s like to travel in one of the prettiest places I’ve ever been.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki is great for cycling! Little traffic, smooth roads, and beautiful views.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Arrival Process is Unexpectedly Easy;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I exited the airport in Rarotonga, I noticed a large Cook Islands mama greeting every passenger from my flight and welcoming them individually. I figured it was some kind of thing to do with the resorts — I was travelling on a tight budget — so I skirted past her.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Not so fast.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
She ran after me and asked where I was staying. When I gave her the name of my hostel, she directed me to another mama a few metres away. She then walked me out into the car park and led me to a specific spot. Wait here for your transfer, she told me, and moments later, the owner of my hostel arrived.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was all so easy and unexpected. No matter where you’re going to be staying on the island, the mamas will show you where to go. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Muri Lagoon, on Rarotonga. This was one of my favourite spots to sunbathe and snorkel.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It Can be a Budget Destination;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve published an enormous guide on how to visit the Cook Islands on a budget so if, like me, you’re keen to save money, that blog post will show you it’s more than possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Rarotonga, dorm rooms in hostels on the beach start from $20 a night, transportation with the local bus comes in at $5 per ride, or $25 for ten journeys, and you can grab a meal from a beach shack for around $10-15.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Aitutaki, hostels don’t exist, so your best bet is a budget guesthouse. You can get these from $50 a night for a cute bungalow in a peaceful location. Transportation is easy here, with bikes available for free from most accommodation, or $7 a day if not. Lagoon tours will be your major expense, coming in at $50-70 for a full day out on the water, but it’s definitely worth the splurge.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The beach outside my guesthouse on Aitutaki. Look how shallow the lagoon is!;;;;;;;;;

I Didn’t Meet Another Solo Traveler While I Was There;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent ten days in the Cook Islands, stayed in a dorm room in a hostel, and still didn’t meet another solo traveller.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s no doubt about it: this is a destination for families and honeymooners. In fact, the immigration arrival card even had options to tick if you were coming for a wedding or honeymoon! Even at the hostels, there were only backpacking couples on round-the-world trips or people opting for a cheaper honeymoon to hang out with.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Having said that, I didn’t struggle to meet people. The couples I hung out with on Rarotonga and Aitutaki were welcoming and happy for me to tag along with them, even if I felt as though I was totally intruding on their honeymoon. You’ll meet people in the Cook Islands as a solo traveller, but they’ll probably be a part of a couple.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My favourite viewpoint on Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Don’t Skip Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I was researching the Cook Islands, practically every article I came across online urged me to spend as little time on Rarotonga as possible, and as much on Aitutaki. I dutifully booked 48 hours on the island and five full nights on Aitutaki, but left feeling like I should have had more of an even split.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Because here’s the thing: Aitutaki’s lagoon is the most beautiful place I’ve ever visited, hands down. But the island itself wasn’t that amazing for me. The beaches weren’t great, you can cycle around the entire island in half a day, and there just wasn’t all that much to do. I ended up being bored in Aitutaki by the end of my stay, then returning to Rarotonga and wishing I had longer there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, don’t overlook Rarotonga. I mean, if you had to choose just one island, I’d say go to Aitutaki to see the lagoon, but if you have a week in the Cook Islands, go for a 4/3 day split.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The island where I had lunch on my lagoon cruise and probably the prettiest place I’ve ever been.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Air Rarotonga is Crazy-Expensive;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The only way to get from Rarotonga to Aitutaki is via Air Rarotonga, and the prices are high.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But there is a way to minimise the cost: book the second you decide you want to visit, because the prices will only increase the closer you get to your dates! I booked my flights less than two weeks before arriving and ended up paying $250 each way. For a thirty. minute. flight. A quick look at Air Rarotonga’s website shows me that prices drop the further out you book, with June and July offering $120 each way. Still crazy expensive, but much more affordable than a $500 round-trip!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The other alternative is to just turn up in Rarotonga, head to the Air Rarotonga office and book through them. There are reports of people getting fares for half the price by booking last-minute this way, but you do run the risk of their being no availability on any of the flights.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

The Cook Islands Has the Best Coins Ever;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Where else in the world will you find a country that has triangle- and wiggly-shaped coins? Nowhere! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ll pay for most things in New Zealand dollars in the Cook Islands, but when it comes to smaller purchases, you can use the kickass Cook Islands coins.;;;;;;;;;

The Locals are Incredibly Friendly;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I always say that the Taiwanese were the friendliest people I’ve met on my travels, but I think the Cook Islanders may have just knocked them off the top spot. Over and over again, I experienced such warmth from the locals I ran into.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I was succumbing to heatstroke and struggling to walk, a Cook Islands mama pulled over on her scooter and offered me a free ride back to my hostel. When I arrived at a new guesthouse, I was welcomed with an enormous embrace. When I mentioned to my lagoon cruise tour guide that I hadn’t been up to the island viewpoint yet, he took an hour out of his day to scooter me to the top of Aitutaki and show me his favourite views. Everyone you pass calls out hello and it’s so wonderful.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There’s basically no crime on the islands and I felt so safe there, even as a solo woman wandering around at night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
More lagoon goodness! The water was that shallow for around 100 metres and you could walk to different islands through it!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You Can’t Skip the Lagoon Cruises in Aitutaki;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I almost skipped the lagoon tour in Aitutaki, reasoning that being on a boat all day would make me seasick and snorkelling always gives me a headache and brings me out in a rash.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That would have been the biggest mistake of my travels, because oh my god, you have to see the lagoon. It’s the closest I’ve ever come to being in paradise. I wrote about my experience in depth here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Giant clams! They were the size of me and there were hundreds of them where we went snorkelling!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Favourite island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Grocery Shopping Sucks;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re planning on saving money by cooking, expect to live off of crap food. In Aitutaki, especially, where cargo arrives only once every three months, expect to find rows of tinned food and bags of chips and candy, and little vegetables or fresh meat/fish.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you want fresh food, you’ll either have to befriend a local or find out when the market runs and hit it up in the early hours of the day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A small tin of baked beans was $5! Prices were high. I actually found it cheaper to eat out for dinner and grab some snacks from the grocery stores for lunch.;;;;;;;;;

Expect to Spend Most of Your Time Offline;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Free Wi-Fi does not exist in the Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t find a free Internet connection anywhere.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Instead, you’ll have to either opt for the despicable Zenbu, who charges $10 per 100 mb. Or Vodafone Cook Islands — who are much better. It’s still ridiculously expensive — the priciest rates I’ve found anywhere in the world and every restaurant, cafe, and guesthouse uses one of those two providers. Most of the connections are barely usable, and if you can get online, prepare for speeds to be slllloooowwwwww.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In comparison, free Wi-Fi was everywhere I visited in French Polynesia, Tonga, and Fiji.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The best deal I found was at my guesthouse in Aitutaki: I booked it because the Booking listing said it had free Wi-Fi, then arrived to discover they charged $10 per 150 mb.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You can pick up a local SIM card for $25, but data rates still start at $10 per 1GB, valid for 7 days. Much better than using hotel Wi-Fi, but still very expensive. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But really, just plan to spend most of your time offline in the Cook Islands and relish in it! I’d been planning to work in the evenings on my trip, but instead worked my way through half a dozen books. I came away feeling far more relaxed than if I’d been trying to get blog posts written while I was there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Hell yes. I loved my time there. The locals were so warm and friendly, travelling on a budget wasn’t horrendous, I doubt I’ll ever go anywhere as spectacular as Aitutaki, and I’m already plotting my return! If you’re looking for paradise, head to the Cook Islands. It’s amazing.;;;;;;;;;

For over 15 years, the company has been running tours beneath the city, opening up access to air raid shelters, bunkers, fortresses, and escape tunnels. My parents took a tour with them a couple of years ago and have raved about it ever since, so experiencing it first-hand was right at the top of my list of things to do in Berlin.;;;;;;;;;
I planned to jump on tour M, which takes you beneath the Berlin Wall and through the escape tunnels dug by East Berliners fleeing to the West during the Cold War.;;;;;;;;;
Well, something really frustrating about this tour company is that they don’t let you book tickets in advance; you can only buy them on the same day as you want to take the tour. I rocked up a couple of hours before my chosen tour was leaving, assuming that would be early enough, but nope! They were all sold out.;;;;;;;;
I was gutted, especially as it was my last day in Berlin, so I couldn’t put it off for another day.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, there was a different tour — Tour 1; the Dark Worlds Tour — leaving in half an hour, and it did still have tickets available. I knew nothing about it, but bought one anyway.;;;;;;;;
Berlin’s holocaust memorial;;;;;;;;;
Here’s what it had in store for me:;;;;;;;;;
Everyday hundreds of people walk past a green door in the Gesundbrunnen underground railway station, unaware that within lies a subterranean labyrinth full of history just waiting to be experienced.;;;;;;;;;
Berlin was the nerve centre of the Third Reich and therefore one of the main targets for allied bombing during WWII. On this tour our expert guides will lead you in exploring one of the few remaining bunkers, as it was left after the war. There you will learn more about the life of the average Berlin citizen during the air-raids that destroyed up to 80% of the city’s centre. Travelling through the twisting passages and rooms, you will also see countless artefacts from the war that have been buried for decades.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There were around twenty people taking the tour with me, and sadly, photography was not permitted, so I can’t show you any photos of what the bunker looked like.;;;;;;;;;
But suffice to say, it was eerie and depressing, the rooms were cramped, the air was thick, damp, and heavy, and though I don’t normally get claustrophobic, I felt suffocated as we descended into the shelter.;;;;;;;;;
And the entrance is just how it was described above: you enter the subway station, make a turn, and there’s a huge, heavy door that marks the entrance to the shelter. If you hadn’t taken one of these tours, you’d have no idea what was behind it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Over the next hour, I gained a fascinating insight into the lives of Berlin citizens during the air raids of the second World War, from observing the composting toilets that were used by everyone, to huddling in the tiny, cramped rooms that were for mothers and children.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Many of the rooms were painted in toxic phosphorescent paint — which we were warned not to touch multiple times — so that whenever the power was cut, the rooms would illuminate in an eerie shade of green. This glow can still be seen clearly today whenever the lights are turned off.;;;;;;;;;
Which, yes, did make me feel pretty nervous.;;;;;;;;;
One of the stories that stuck most with me was when our guide described how they’d monitor the levels of oxygen in the room.;;;;;;;;;
With so many people crammed into such a small space, and with oxygen rising to the ceiling and carbon dioxide sinking, candles would be used to figure out how much longer civilians could remain in safety.;;;;;;;;;
First, they’d place a candle on the floor. As soon as it flickered out, they’d place another one on a wooden bench and bring the children up onto their laps. When that flame was extinguished, there was one final candle that would be held at waist height, while everyone stood on the benches.;;;;;;;;;
And when that candle went out? Everyone would have to leave, even if there was a full-on air raid taking place outside the door. Their choice was to either suffocate or take the risk of being bombed above ground.;;;;;;;;;
Shudder.;;;;;;;;;
And given what’s currently going on in the world, our tour guide drew many parallels between Hitler and a certain presidential candidate that she clearly despised. Somebody asked how Hitler could have been democratically elected, and the answer was startlingly familiar: by creating a sense of fear among German citizens; by telling them that Germany’s problems had all been caused by the Jews; and by claiming that he could make Germany great again.;;;;;;;
As a British person, I have to say the tour was full of valuable insights. I guess during history lessons in school, it was always just us being taught that *the Germans* were the enemy. I’d never really stopped to consider the experiences of German civilians at the time. Having their experiences brought to life and learning about how terrifying this would have been to them was, well, awful. I came away feeling that it had been so important for me to go on this tour to gain this new outlook into what civilians went through at this time.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Speaking of being British…;;;;;;;;;
The Brandenburg Gate;;;;;;;;;
Towards the end of the tour, we stopped in a tiny room and huddled up close together on small benches.;;;;;;;;;
“And as the British dropped these bombs,” the tour guide started, before pausing. “Do we have anyone British here by the way?”;;;;;;;;;
I stared straight down at my feet.;;;;;;;;;
That was kind of an awkward question to ask, and as everyone else remained silent, I wasn’t going to be the lone Brit to be shamed by the group. I didn’t know what the guide was going to say about my Britishness, but I was certain it wasn’t going to be positive.;;;;;;;;;
I kept my lips firmly closed.;;;;;;;;;
“No British people? Okay. Well, let’s find out where you’re all from then.”;;;;;;;;;
My eyes widened and she began going around in a circle, pointing at people one-by-one and asking where they had come from.;;;;;;;;;
“Holland,” a couple called out.;;;;;;;;;
“Israel,” said someone else.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Shit,” I whispered to myself.;;;;;;;;;
What was I going to say? I couldn’t just come out and say that I was British after deliberately remaining silent! But what else was I going to say? I have a British accent! I can’t do any other accents. My accents are terrible. The Worst. ;;;;;;;;;
Where the hell should I say I’m from?;;;;;;;;;
The guide was closing in on me now; there were only two people ahead of me and they were both American, which meant I definitely couldn’t say I was from anywhere in North America. I’d be found out immediately.;;;;;;;;
Where hadn’t anyone said they were from? What accent can I do?;;;;;;;;;
Oh god.;;;;;;;;;
I was still racking my brains to think of a country when the guide’s finger landed on me.;;;;;;;;;
I looked up.;;;;;;;;;
She raised her eyebrows expectantly.;;;;;;;;;
“I, uh…”;;;;;;;;;
“Where are you from?”;;;;;;;;;
“New Zealand,” I blurted out.;;;;;;;;;
Except, I tried to do a New Zealand accent at the time and kind of squeaked out, “Noo Zulund” and then turned crimson red.;;;;;;;;;
“New Zealand!” somebody exclaimed. “You’ve come from the other side of the world.”;;;;;;;;;
I nodded and smiled, running through Dave’s geographical history in my head.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll tell them I grew up in Ashburton, but lived in Christchurch for a few years. That my accent isn’t strong because I lived in the U.K. for three years. Oh god, please don’t ask me any questions. Please don’t make me say anything else in my terrible, terrible accent. ;;;;;;;;;
“Which island?” somebody asked.;;;;;;;;;
“South Island,” I whispered in my New Zealand accent that was starting to sound strangely like an Indian one.;;;;;;;;;
I then had to spend the rest of the tour avoiding eye contact and making sure I didn’t accidentally say anything or draw attention to myself, in case it led to me having to open my mouth.;;;;;;;;;
And that was how I took a tour of a Berlin air raid shelter as a New Zealander.;;;;;;;;;

Aside from that mishap, I loved this tour. It was fascinating, well-run, and I was captivated by our guide’s stories the entire time. Given that it’s just €11 for a 90-minute tour, it’s well-worth the money and I highly recommend it.;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Any downsides? The tour was kind of boring at the end. Once we finished the World War II segment, we moved on to learning about the subway’s use in more recent times, such as keeping beer cold, and how the station was part of a pneumatic postal system. It felt that these sections had been shoved on to the end to lengthen the tour, and I didn’t pay all that much attention to them.;;;;;;;;;
And not just because I was practicing my New Zealand accent in my head.;;;;;;;;;
If you do decide to check out one of the underground tours of Berlin, don’t do what I did, and make sure to head to the ticket office in the morning to ensure you get a spot on the tour you want. You can see a full list of what tours they offer and their times here.;;;;;;;;;
This was one of the best tours I’ve ever taken, and I’m looking forward to trying out a second one when I return to Berlin in the spring. Because I will be returning in the spring: that’s how much I loved Berlin! I really want to show Dave around one of my new favourite cities, but not in winter.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;

I’d just finished the Whole30 and felt the best I had in, well, forever. I couldn’t believe that after all this time, a change of diet was all it had taken to completely transform my mental and physical health.;;;;;;;;;
With my anxiety under control, my confidence pouring over the brim, and my wanderlust creeping back in, I bought a one-way ticket out of Lisbon and began a summer of hardcore travel.;;;;;;;;;
Shakshuka for brunch in hipster Hackney;;;;;;;;;
First on my agenda was spending two weeks back home in the U.K.;;;;;;;;;
I try to see my family and friends at least once or twice a year, and now that I’m based in Lisbon, there’s no excuse for me not to visit. I landed in London and made my way over to Hackney, a place that is known as being awful by much of the U.K.;;;;;;;;;
Hackney still has a reputation as a reasonably dangerous area of London — parts of it were even known as Murder Mile in past. But gentrification is coming quickly, and Hackney has actually experienced a larger drop of crime than any other London borough in recent years. In short, if Dave and I ever stand a chance of being able to afford to live in my beloved homeland, an area like Hackney will give us a good chance — we’d be looking for somewhere that’s a little rough around the edges, a place people still think is a shithole, and an area of London that’s more affordable than most.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Even better: I have a strong family connection to Hackney. My dad was raised in neighbouring Bethnal Green and tells stories of a childhood filled with jellied eels for dinner after long summer afternoons spent playing football in Hackney parks. How awesome would it be if I ended up planting my roots in an area with such deep ties to my dad’s side of my family?;;;;;;;;;
One of my first meals after arriving in London? Fish and chips, of course!;;;;;;;;;
And guys? I seriously fell in love with Hackney.;;;;;;;;;
As we arrived at our apartment, Broadway Market was in full force, and I immediately declared it the best food market I’ve ever been to in London. If you’re ever in East London on a Sunday, you need to go there — trust me.;;;;;;;;;
I arrived in London on a beautiful sunny day, sat myself down outside a beautiful pub with a cider in hand, and spent my afternoon watching people with a huge grin plastered across my face.;;;;;;;;;
Hackney? Yeah, I could totally live there.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t have much time to stop and stare, though. As always, my time in London was busy and action-packed, and I spent much of it tube-hopping my way from friend to friend, and sampling as many new restaurants, bars, and cafes as I could cram in.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One highlight from my time in London? Checking out All or Nothing, a musical about the Small Faces, who I adore. The theatre is underneath Waterloo station and hearing the trains passing by overhead only served to add to the atmosphere.;;;;;;;;;
I also can’t forget our romantic evening spent at an outdoor cinema in Battersea Park. Watching a film with Dave as the sun set over the city was just as magical as it sounds. We threw some wine and blankets into the mix and it couldn’t have been more perfect.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When our time in London drew to a close, Dave and I journeyed north, which, if you know me, you’ll know is a journey I never take. Aside from six hours in Manchester when I was applying to the university there, I don’t think I have ever been north of London within the U.K. before! We weren’t going far this time, though, and ended our trip in Oxford. Dave’s brother is doing his PhD at Oxford University, so we paid him a visit for a few days and spent our time snooping around various college grounds.;;;;;;;;;
After a couple of days at home with my family, it was time for my very first visit to Greece!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally.;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I kicked off our travels in Corfu, which was a place I expected to be full of chavs, but was actually somewhere I really liked.;;;;;;;;;
I loved Corfu’s chilled-out vibe and spent the vast majority of my four days there wandering through the Old Town. And that was the best way to explore Corfu Town: gazing up at the crumbling, colourful buildings and feta-hopping from cafe to restaurant.;;;;;;;;;
I can’t not mention Corfu’s old fortress, which was full of fascinating history and fun to clamber all over. And the Banknote Museum, obvs.;;;;;;;;;
We celebrated Dave’s birthday while we were there, and yes, I took him to Corfu’s banknote museum as a treat. And it was one of the best museums we’ve ever been to.;;;;;;;;;
Who knew that you could learn so much about a country’s history through its banknotes?;;;;;;;;;
I would totally return to Corfu Town in the future, and I most likely will next year.;;;;;;;;;
Corfu Town’s fortress;;;;;;;;;
Then, terrifyingly, it was time to board a boat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Somehow, I had managed to lose my mind and sign up for week-long sailing trip around the Ionian islands with Dave and his friends.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll share a confession here and say that when I last took a sailing trip with Dave, in Turkey back in 2012, I hated every single second of it. I had been suffering from an ear disorder that’d left me with vertigo, there had been a lot of people crammed into a small space, which is always a struggle for an introvert, and I got seriously severe seasickness. By the end of that trip, I’d felt as though I’d spent $1500 to spend two weeks feeling like death.;;;;;;;;;
But throughout that experience, everyone on the yacht had told me that sailing in Turkey was nothing like sailing in Greece. In Greece, the water was warm. In Greece, the food and the beer was better. In Greece, everything was cheaper. In Greece, the scenery was more impressive. In Greece, the water was as calm as a swimming pool.;;;;;;;;;
I decided to join a second yacht trip for those very reasons. I knew Dave’s sailing trips were one of his favourite things to do, and I wanted to share in that experience with him. I decided this was to be my last chance trip. If I didn’t like sailing in Greece, I would most likely never do it again.;;;;;;;;;
So I stepped on board the yacht and pushed my fears of nausea to the back of my mind.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I loved every single second I spent on the water.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Greece was spectacular. The scenery was spectacular. Sailing was spectacular.;;;;;;;;;
Not getting seasick was spectacular.;;;;;;;;;
Yes, to my great surprise, changing up my diet with the Whole30 resulted in my lifelong and severe motion sickness, well, vanishing. I didn’t feel even the slightest bit queasy for the entire time I was on the water.;;;;;;;;;
Considering I used to get sick in swimming pools and the bath and in hammocks and on trains, this was a huge development. One that had me falling hard for sailing. Not experiencing motion sickness opened up a whole new world for me. One where I don’t have to be knocked out on Dramamine in order to get from A to B.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Mornings were my favourite time to be on the water.;;;;;;;;;
The ocean was calm, barely anyone else on neighbouring yachts were awake, so the only sound was the gentle lapping of water against the boat, and the sun was just high enough in the sky for it to be warm, but not sweat-inducing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Those mornings were the best. Frying up eggs for breakfast with Dave in the kitchen, stretching out in the cockpit and reading my Kindle in the sunshine, and excitedly waiting to find out where we would be exploring later that day.;;;;;;;;;
Most of the time, we’d head to a secluded bay that only had room for one yacht and drop the anchor for an afternoon of swimming and sunbathing. Sometimes, we’d decide to stay the night and spend it drinking vodka, eating pesto, and sleeping beneath the stars.;;;;;;;;;
No matter what we decided, though, it was like, the best day ever.;;;;;;;;;
And now? Now I’m the person pushing for there to be a repeat yacht trip next summer, because I can’t wait longer than that to get back on the water!;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
On every sailing trip, Dave and his friends celebrate their very first morning on the water with something call *The Moment*. As soon as we’ve set sail and reached an open patch of ocean, it’s time to shut off the engine and get the party started.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Someone will run downstairs to blast out some music through the yacht’s speakers — the first song is always Mr Brightside by the Killers — while someone else fills everyone’s cup with a generous pour of Vodka North (a Nordic berries-flavoured vodka that’s hard to find outside of Greece). Then, we all cheers to being in a beautiful part of the world, down our drinks, and leap off the side of the yacht and into the water.;;;;;;;;;
On the yacht trip in Turkey, I’d felt so terrible that I’d sat on the boat and watched everyone have fun without me. In Greece, I jumped headfirst into the whole experience and came up feeling more alive than I’d felt in a long time.;;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Sadly, the after effects of the Whole30 hit me hard this month.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out that when you eliminate all inflammation-causing foods from your diet, your stomach will want to kill you when you reintroduce them.;;;;;;;;;
For me, that meant agonising stomach cramps, even when I was eating Whole30 meals 80% of the time.;;;;;;;;;
I was conflicted this month, because the Whole30 was the best thing I’ve ever done for my health, but I ended up feeling as though I would never, ever be able to get back to a more normal diet. A glass of wine gave me stomach cramps, a slice of bread gave me stomach cramps, a small bar of chocolate gave me stomach cramps. And because it’s almost impossible to keep up with a Whole30-type diet while travelling, I began to wonder if every trip I’ll take from now on will be all about pain.;;;;;;;;;
At one point, I went out for a walk with my family and spent the final half of it shuffling while bent double, because the pain was so strong.;;;;;;;;;
So it’s tough. I mean, clearly the diet I had before wasn’t right for me, so the fact that I can’t go back to it without experiencing pain is sort of a good thing. But also, having such a restrictive diet and not being able to veer from it kills your social life and means you’re forever doomed to go out with friends and drink water.;;;;;;;;;
We’ll see what happens.;;;;;;;;;
Instagram of the Month;;;;;;;;;
I’m focusing on improving my Instagram account this year, and I’m excited to share my progress in my summaries! This month, my most popular photo was a flashback to one of my favourite beaches in the world, in Tulum, Mexico. This photo racked up a whopping 1,415 likes!;;;;;;;;;

Coming up next is a whole lot of movement, as I’ll be spending a full month hitting up more of my European oversights.;;;;;;;;;
First on the list is a flying visit to Venice and my first ever attempt at turning a layover into an opportunity to explore a new city. And hopefully not miss my flight.;;;;;;;;;
From Venice, I’ll be heading to two cities I really should have visited by now: Berlin and Paris! I’ll be spending time in each city meeting up with friends, eating good food, and doing as many tourist activities as possible. I’ll also be crossing off one of my goals for 2016 by travelling in a style I never would have considered before. And that style is essentially me going broke over a trip. I’ll be staying in one of the most expensive hotels in Berlin and seeing whether this level of luxury is actually worth it when, y’know, you’re not on a press trip and are actually spending your own money.;;;;;;;;;
From there, I’ll be travelling to Luxembourg to get to know this little country better, and I have plans to hit up both Luxembourg City and Vianden.;;;;;;;;;
From Luxembourg, I’ll be flying south to Nice and taking a trip to Monaco to see how you can visit on a budget. I’m looking forward to seeing what the south of France is like in the shoulder season!;;;;;;;;;
To round off my month of travels, I’ll be revisiting Barcelona and using it as a base to explore Andorra, a brand new country for me, and one that I’m determined to love, as it doesn’t have the best reputation.;;;;;;;;;
"And that’s the plan! An action-packed month of new places for month 62!""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408091-430,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/16"",""Why I Love Luxembourg"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/i-love-luxembourg/"",""Why I Love Luxembourg"",""May 15, 2020"",""Well, that was a surprise!";;;;;;;;;
My favourite new country of 2016 is most probably going to be Luxembourg. I absolutely adored the three days I spent there!;;;;;;;;;
And I’ll be honest with you: I arrived not knowing much about it at all. I knew I was going to be visiting Berlin and Paris, and with Luxembourg located right in the middle of them, I couldn’t resist the chance to check out a new place.;;;;;;;;;
One thing I did know, though, was that I didn’t want my visit to just be about adding a new country to my list. I wanted to explore Luxembourg outside of Luxembourg City and take a lot of day trips around the country. I did my research, learned that I could see a fair chunk of the small country during a three-day visit, and booked my stay.;;;;;;;;;
And now? I’d honestly put it in my top five favourite countries in Europe! Since returning, I’ve been singing its praises to everyone I’ve spoken to. It was probably the highlight of my entire summer travels!;;;;;;;;;
And because there’s a large Portuguese community in Luxembourg, it’s cheap and easy to visit from Lisbon. I’ve already told Dave we’re going to return next year, because I want to show him around!;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg City from above;;;;;;;;;
It’s Seriously Stunning;;;;;;;;;
I still can’t get over how beautiful Luxembourg is.;;;;;;;;;
I usually struggle to be impressed by a place when it’s raining and the skies are washed out and grey, but no matter what the weather was doing in Luxembourg, it was still so pretty!;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg City is built around a ravine, which makes for some dramatic cliffside scenery, while the centre of town is full of grand architecture, a palace, cathedrals, and pastel-coloured buildings.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
And Vianden was just straight out of a fairytale. No words, just look at this photo:;;;;;;;;;
Vianden, as seen from its castle;;;;;;;;;
I Felt So Safe There;;;;;;;;;
As someone with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, of which the main symptom is persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worrying, it’s rare for me to truly feel safe in a place.;;;;;;;;;
But in Luxembourg I did.;;;;;;;;;
In fact, I’d go so far as to say I felt more safe in Luxembourg on my own than I have anywhere else in the world. That could be an exaggeration, but as I’m writing this and going through every country I’ve visited, nowhere else comes to mind. And a quick google just now told me that Luxembourg has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.;;;;;;;;;
So, maybe that was part of the reason why I fell so hard for it. I just felt as though I didn’t have to worry while I was there! I wasn’t constantly watching my bag and guarding my camera; checking that nobody was within grabbing distance as I pulled out my phone. I walked around the streets of Luxembourg City alone at night and felt no fear. I’m not sure why, exactly, I immediately felt so safe there, but I think it had to do with the fact that the city was calm and peaceful, that everyone was dressed smartly, that the streets were clean, and that nobody really paid much attention to me.;;;;;;;;
Side note: Luxembourg is also regularly ranked in the top five cleanest cities in the world, and I can’t disagree with that. I don’t think I saw any litter the whole time I was there.;;;;;;;;;

The Luxembourg flag;;;;;;;;;
The Official Language Spoken is Luxembourgish;;;;;;;;;
I’m including this for no other reason that it makes me laugh. Luxembourgish definitely sounds like something I would make up if Dave asked me what language they spoke there: “Oh, y’know, they just speak, um, Luxembourgish.”;;;;;;;;;
But in all seriousness, given Luxembourg’s location, most of the residents can speak several languages. It’s common for people to be able to speak Luxembourgish, French, German, and Flemish/Dutch, and English was widely spoken, too.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t experience much of a language barrier in Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;

The Luxembourg Card is Amazing Value for Money;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg has a reputation for being incredibly expensive, but I really didn’t feel that way while I was there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
One of the easiest ways for tourists to save money in the country is to pick up a Luxembourg card. Priced at €13 for one day or €28 for three, this card gives you unlimited use of all public transport across the entire country. For free! You also get free access to most of the museums, castles, walking tours, and activities you’d want to do along with it.;;;;;;;;;
When I took a day trip out to Vianden, my return bus and train journeys were free, I didn’t have to pay the entrance fee to the castle and I could even take a free chairlift ride up to a viewpoint, all of which made the card more than worth the money. If it hadn’t been raining during my visit, I would have headed to a different part of the country afterwards, and saved even more money!;;;;;;;;;
If you go to Luxembourg, get the card. It’s great.;;;;;;;;;

It’s Easy to Get Around;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe. Covering an area of 999 square miles, you can drive across the length or width of the country in just over an hour.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that makes exploring easy. Nowhere in the country is too far away for a day trip, and you can easily spend a day in France, Germany, or Belgium, too.;;;;;;;;;
Vianden Castle;;;;;;;;;
Vianden is Like a Fairytale;;;;;;;;;
My day trip to Vianden was the highlight of my trip to Luxembourg. I visited on a Sunday, where the bus to the village runs every hour instead of every half-hour, but that was the only struggle I experienced.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and the rain.;;;;;;;;;
But despite that, I spent my time in Vianden gazing up (and then down) at the incredibly picturesque castle, wandering around the colourful buildings, hiking in the hills, and then whimpering on a juddering chairlift.;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg City;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg: My Favourite Discovery of 2016!;;;;;;;;;
Luxembourg will most likely end up being my favourite discovery of 2016, and it’s easily now one of my favourite countries in Europe! I can see myself returning there often for long weekends spent hiking in the countryside, especially as you can pick up $120 return tickets from Lisbon — as I mentioned above, lots of Portuguese people live in Luxembourg (15% of the population are Portuguese!), which makes it easy and inexpensive for me to fly out there.;;;;;;;;;
Would I ever live in Luxembourg? Probably not. I haven’t added it to my “I Could Live Here One Day” list. I fear I’d be bored if I lived there long-term — I think I’d struggle to find many of my favourite Asian cuisines in the city (although almost half of the population are foreigners, they’re predominantly white Europeans), and it didn’t seem as if there would be a huge amount going on to keep me entertained. And I’m sure that eventually the cleanliness and safety would start to make the city feel a little too sterile.;;;;;;;;;

But so, so worth it.;;;;;;;;;
I thought it would be easy. I had a month to spare in-between leaving New Zealand and arriving in Mexico, so spending that time island hopping my way across the South Pacific made perfect sense. It was the region I’d most wanted to explore back when I first made the decision to travel, and, well, y’know, these places could be underwater sometime in the near future, thanks to climate change.;;;;;;;;;
Little did I know, this trip would end up being the trickiest I’ve ever had to plan.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve been receiving an increasing number of emails from people wanting to know exactly how I plan trips, and especially how I plan trips to expensive places on a budget. The South Pacific seems like a good place to start because the planning process was complicated, time-consuming, and made me want to cry. If you’re planning a trip to the South Pacific, hopefully this post will eliminate some of the stress.;;;;;;;;;
Or not, because it really is that frustrating.;;;;;;;;;
But either way, here’s how I did it!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Step One: Start By Deciding Where You Want to Go;;;;;;;;;
The South Pacific countries aren’t as well-known or visited as many other places around the world, so this step will likely involve a fair bit of research. There are a dozen-odd countries spread out across the ocean in the South Pacific, with some of them offering hundreds of islands to visit within them.;;;;;;;;;
Take French Polynesia: Did you know the islands of this nation are spread out over an area of ocean the same size as Europe? There’s the Society Islands that comprise a dozen islands. There’s the Tuamotos, a string of 80 atolls stretching roughly over the size of Western Europe. The Marquesas, one of the most remote island groups in the world, 900 miles and a 3.5 hour flight from Tahiti. The Gambier Islands, which consist of 14 volcanic islands inside a large lagoon. And the Austral Islands, quiet land masses with a few guesthouses and the most authentic Polynesian culture.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You could spend a decade exploring French Polynesia and still end up seeing very little of it.;;;;;;;;;
Making the decision about where to go, then, can be overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;
To start, I recommend finding an enormous map of the region online, and then start to eliminate the places you can’t justify visiting, using the following criteria:;;;;;;;;;
Lagoon in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands;;;;;;;;;
Do I Need a Visa to Visit?;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t going to have a huge amount of time to apply for a visa on this trip. I would be travelling reasonably quickly around Australia and New Zealand and it was over the holiday season, too, so embassies would be closed. Anywhere in the South Pacific that therefore had a complicated entry process was immediately knocked off my list in favour of an easier trip. In the case of the South Pacific, here are my results (with a U.K. passport):;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Crossing off the list:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Nauru (reports suggest this is one of the hardest visas in the world to obtain, so that’s a no);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In the clear:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
American Samoa (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Cook Islands (31 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Fiji (4 months on arrival);;;;;;;;;
French Polynesia (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Kiribati (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Marshall Islands (90 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Micronesia (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
New Caledonia (90 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Palau (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Samoa (60 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Solomon Islands (90 days on arrival) ;;;;;;;;;
Tonga (31 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Tuvalu (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
Vanuatu (30 days on arrival);;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That didn’t help much with eliminating countries, but did prove to show me just how fortunate I am to have a British passport. North Americans, Europeans, and Antipodeans also won’t have many problems with obtaining visas for the South Pacific.;;;;;;;;;

Can I Visit on a Budget?;;;;;;;;;
I’m a budget traveller the vast majority of the time, and I specifically wanted this trip to be all about proving that luxury destinations can be done on the cheap. My next step, then, was to eliminate any countries that could only offer me expensive hotels and resorts. Given that you’re reading a guide about how to visit the South Pacific on a budget, I suspect you’re aiming to do exactly the same.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I usually start this research stage by googling, “[country name] on a budget” to see if any travel writers have visited before me and have any helpful advice to share. You can see my budget guides for the Cook Islands, Bora Bora, and Tonga as starting points for your research if any of those places appeal to you.;;;;;;;;;
If nothing much comes up there, I next head to WikiTravel to see what’s written about the country and how much you should budget for a trip there. There’s usually a few sections to give you a good estimate of how much you can expect to spend on accommodation, transportation, and food.;;;;;;;;;
Finally, I take matters into my own hands and start searching for affordable accommodation options online. To find cheap places to stay, I go to HostelWorld and search for the country name to see if there are any hostels listed. If nothing comes up there, I open HotelsCombined (they search for the best prices on Agoda, Booking, Expedia, etc), search for the specific country, and sort the hotel results by price.;;;;;;;;;
I start with accommodation options first, because that’s the easiest and fastest way to see if budget travel is a possibility — if there are no cheap hotels, I can’t visit inexpensively.;;;;;;;;;
For my South Pacific trip in 2018, I found the following places to be tough to visit on a budget, so eliminated them from my list:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
American Samoa has no hostels listed online and my HotelsCombined search didn’t bring up anything for less than $110 a night, so that’s off the cards.;;;;;;;;;
Marshall Islands: I could only find one accommodation option in the entire country for under $100 a night, and it didn’t sound very nice, so that’s them out of the picture.;;;;;;;;;
Micronesia has no hostels, and just one hotel for under $100 a night. Unfortunately, it sounds terrible.;;;;;;;;;
Tuvalu has one guesthouse listed, and while it receives great reviews, I’m a little concerned about travelling to somewhere that only has one option for accommodation so I’ll be eliminating that, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Here’s where I have left: Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, New Caledonia, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.;;;;;;;;;
Now it’s time to try to get these 10 down to a more manageable list.;;;;;;;;;
Aitutaki, the Cook Islands. Yeah, you should definitely go there.;;;;;;;;;
Are They Nice, Though?;;;;;;;;;
The next criteria I use to see if I want to visit somewhere is to check that the places actually look nice. As a Brit who assumed every South Pacific island was stunningly beautiful, for example, I was shocked when, back in 2011, Dave showed me a photo of Nauru.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Spoiler: it’s not pretty.;;;;;;;;;
It’s also home to some pretty horrific examples of human rights abuse, so it definitely isn’t an island you should be setting sail for.;;;;;;;;;
I think it’s important to research which island you’ll be visiting. There might be some incredible islands in a particular South Pacific country, but if the only affordable accommodation is in the capital on an ugly island, you’re not going to have the dream trip you’ve been imagining.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, all of the islands I had left on my list were gorgeous, so this didn’t help me eliminate anywhere else. In fact, all it did was make me want to go to a dozen islands in every single country over the space of a month.;;;;;;;;;
Flying over Bora Bora, French Polynesia;;;;;;;;;
Are They Easy to Get To?;;;;;;;;;
Finally, it’s time to start checking out the logistics. Palau is way up near the Philippines, for example, which makes it expensive to get to and hard to include in a sensible itinerary. Kiribati is also fairly expensive to reach from New Zealand, as is the Solomon Islands. Everywhere else on my list is reasonably easy to get to and between (famous last words), so they’ll stay on the list of possibles.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
After all of this elimination, I’ve ended up with Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu as destinations I could potentially visit on this trip.;;;;;;;;;
With a full month in the region, I decided I’d most likely try to visit three different countries over that time, so I definitely have some further eliminating to do.;;;;;;;;;
It’s time to form a route!;;;;;;;;;
Taking off from Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
Step Two: How to Find Cheap Flights in the South Pacific;;;;;;;;;
This was the worst thing ever.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent well over 100 hours looking at flights and trying to form a route that made sense for my trip.;;;;;;;;;
And just when I thought I found the perfect route? Something would screw it all up. Usually the discovery that it would cost $2,000 and 48 hours to get from my final island destination to Mexico, where I needed to be next.;;;;;;;;;
The South Pacific is a popular destination for honeymooners and round-the-world-trippers, but it’s pretty under-visited by independent travellers — most likely because it’s a pain in the ass to get from place to place. But it’s also most likely a pain in the ass to get from place to place because not many travellers are trying to do exactly that.;;;;;;;;;
What that means is that it’s hard to find direct flights from one island country to another. You’ll frequently find that to get from Samoa to Vanuatu, you’ll have to fly from Samoa back to New Zealand and then onwards to Vanuatu because so few people are actually island-hopping around the Pacific. Sometimes you’ll discover that the cheapest and easiest way to get from Vanuatu to the Cook Islands is via a 48-hour journey with a layover in China.;;;;;;;;;
Yes, really.;;;;;;;;;
Flights are rarely direct, and if you do happen to find a direct flight, you’ll most likely discover that it only runs once a week and doesn’t in any way fit into your itinerary.;;;;;;;;;
This is what it’s like to plan a trip to multiple countries in the South Pacific.;;;;;;;;;
The main road in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands;;;;;;;;;
So, let’s take a look at my specific trip and I’ll run you through how I decided where to go.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ll be leaving from New Zealand, so my first step is to head to Skyscanner and search for one-way flights from Auckland to [country name] over the week I’m planning to fly out. I want to see which country is cheapest to fly to from New Zealand.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out that the most inexpensive flight from Auckland is to Tonga for $239. Other affordable starting destinations are Samoa ($255), Fiji ($273), the Cook Islands ($293), and Vanuatu ($321). Kiribati and French Polynesia are out of the question at $600 and $800 respectively.;;;;;;;;;
Tonga sounds amazing, so I settle with that for my first destination. Next, on Skyscanner, I search for all flights from within Tonga to all flights within [every country remaining on my list].;;;;;;;;;
Tonga to the French Polynesia involves a 28 hour layover in Auckland and costs $600.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tonga to Kiribati involves a 37 hour layover in Fiji and costs $900.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But Samoa is just $200. Bingo!;;;;;;;;;
Then it’s time to look at flights from Samoa to every country in the South Pacific, using Skyscanner once more.;;;;;;;;;
There are no flights from Samoa to the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, or Kiribati.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But you can get to Vanuatu for just $185.;;;;;;;;;
That’s my three flights sorted! I’ll go to Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, and then… oh, damn it. To get to Mexico involves 50 hours of flying and $1600.;;;;;;;;;
The absolutely incredible Matafonua Lodge in Tonga.;;;;;;;;;
Hmmm. ;;;;;;;;;
I try again. This time I plan to fly to Vanuatu first. From there, the cheapest place to fly to is Samoa for $279. The only affordable flights from Samoa are to French Polynesia. From French Polynesia, the only affordable place I can get to is the Cook Islands, but that flight runs only once a week and doesn’t tie in with my travel plans. And then, it’s just as expensive and time-consuming to get from the Cook Islands to Mexico as it is from Vanuatu.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was at this point that I thought about giving up and just going to Fiji for a month. ;;;;;;;;;
I tried again. Auckland to Fiji. Fiji to Kiribati. Kiribati to… I can fly to both Tonga and Vanuatu from Kiribati, but both flights only leave once a week, take 27 hours, and involve a layover back in Fiji.;;;;;;;;;
I spent an entire week wrestling with Skyscanner until I found two options that weren’t crazy expensive and worked for my dates:;;;;;;;;;
New Zealand – Tonga – Samoa – Vanuatu – Fiji – Mexico;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
New Zealand – The Cook Islands – French Polynesia – Fiji – Mexico;;;;;;;;;
It was then time to figure out which itinerary would work best for me, and I did that by looking at specific accommodation options for each place.;;;;;;;;;
An affordable guesthouse in Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
Step Three: Finding Cheap Accommodation in the South Pacific;;;;;;;;;
The last thing I want to happen is for me to book my flights and find out all the accommodation I’d looked at isn’t available any more.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That’s happened to me way more frequently than I’d like to admit.;;;;;;;;;
So, my next step is to open up HotelsCombined and enter in my specific travel dates to see what’s available in my potential destinations. I want to check that I won’t find myself in a situation where all of the cheap accommodation is fully-booked, leaving me to pay out for a luxury hotel instead.;;;;;;;;;
I work quickly here, because I have also managed to book all of my accommodation for a place before and then found the cheap flights I had been planning to take have disappeared.;;;;;;;;;
All of this means you can’t spend weeks or even days dithering over your options. Book everything as soon as you’ve made your decision.;;;;;;;;;
In this situation, this didn’t help me make a decision. Every place I looked at had available accommodation for my stay that had great reviews and was within my budget of $30-70 a night.;;;;;;;;;
Muri Lagoon, in Rarotonga;;;;;;;;;
Step Four: Where Interests Me the Most;;;;;;;;;
This had to be my deciding factor.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu: they all looked amazing, but I struggled to find as much information about them online as I could the other destinations. They didn’t look as beautiful, and they sounded trickier to travel around.;;;;;;;;;
Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Fiji: Fiji is popular with backpackers who often island hop around the Yasawa Islands, which I’d always wanted to do, the Cook Islands is often a stopover on round-the-world trips, and French Polynesia has Bora Bora and I knew a guide about visiting it on the cheap would do well. Not only did these islands look more beautiful, but I knew that writing about them here would be more beneficial to you guys, too.;;;;;;;;;
My decision had been made.;;;;;;;;;
How beautiful is Tonga?;;;;;;;;;
Step Five: Buy Travel Insurance;;;;;;;;;
You know it! Travel insurance is so important, and weirdly, during the two times when I haven’t bothered to buy it for a trip I got caught up in a tsunami evacuation and had my boat start to sink in Thailand. I took that as a sign that I should never be without insurance.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Just like how I make sure to book my flights and accommodation as soon as I’ve decided where I want to go, I buy my travel insurance, too. I’ve been using World Nomads for five years and counting and have been super happy whenever I’ve had to deal with them.;;;;;;;;;
View from my $65 a night apartment in Raiatea;;;;;;;;;
Would I Have Done Anything Differently?;;;;;;;;;
Overall, I believe I made the right decision and I rank my time in the South Pacific as one of the best trips I’ve ever taken. You’ve seen the photos in this post: I spent an entire month in paradise!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My one concern about this trip was that the destinations I’d chosen might be too touristy and busy, and therefore expensive, but I didn’t find that to be the case at all. The great thing about the budget travel scene in these countries is that most of the luxury travellers hide away in their resorts all day, leaving the islands free for the budget travellers to play on. Even on Bora Bora, I was surprised by how quiet the island was.;;;;;;;;;
The only thing I didn’t plan for on this trip (and should have done) was travel burnout. Three days on Rarotonga; four days on Aitutaki; one day on Rarotonga; one day on Tahiti; three days on Maupiti; three days on Raiatea; three days on Huahine; three days on Bora Bora.;;
Phew!;;;;;;;;;
I don’t think I’ll ever visit anywhere as beautiful as Aitutaki;;;;;;;;;
I found it tough to slow down in the South Pacific when there were so many thousands of beautiful islands to see and I had such a short amount of time in which to visit as many as possible.;;;;;;;;;

I ended up so exhausted after French Polynesia that I actually ended up cutting out Fiji and flew to Mexico early instead, via the worst travel day ever.;;;;;;;;;
I should have aimed for two countries over the space of a month, rather than three. When I returned to the South Pacific for two weeks a couple of years later, I decided to spend the entire fortnight in Tonga and it gave me a greater insight into the country.;;;;;;;;;
That’s something I’ll be taking on board at the end of 2018, because I’ll be heading back to the South Pacific once more! Part of me wants to return to the Cook Islands and French Polynesia to check out some of the lesser-visited islands; another part of me wants to return to Fiji and spend an entire month island-hopping; and another part of me is desperate to check out some new countries and head to Samoa and Vanuatu.;;;;;;;
I can’t tell you where I’ll be going yet, but I can tell you that, man, I’m not looking forward to the planning process.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
And that’s how you plan an island hopping adventure in the South Pacific! What’s the trickiest trip you’ve ever had to plan?;;;;;;;;;

In front of me stretched five miles of beach with nothing but the occasional jellyfish dotted along the shore.;;;;;;;;;
I had the entire beach to myself.;;;;;;;;;
Literally.;;;;;;;;;
I was the only person here.;;;;;;;;;
I laid down on my towel, pulled out a book from my bag, and set about spending another afternoon in my African beach paradise.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Tofo, despite being the most popular hangout for backpackers in Mozambique, is still sleepy.;;;;;;;;;
From the descriptions I’d read online, I’d been expecting something like a Mozambican Boracay, but arrived to find somewhere more like a Koh Yao Noi.;;;;;;;;;
To call Tofo a town feels like a stretch. It’s small. It comprises of half a dozen sandy “roads”, and there’s a tiny market, a few restaurants and bars, four dive shops, and a handful of guesthouses. The nearest ATM is a 30-minute walk away and power cuts are frequent. And by the way, it totally is pronounced tofu.;;;;;;;;;
On my first morning, I wandered into the main part of town and was surprised to find just a handful of locals setting up stalls for the day. There were no tourists, no touts, and just a few places open.;;;;;;;;;
I took that as my cue to wander onto the beach with my book and the fresh coconut I’d bought for 50 cents.;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t help that I was visiting Mozambique in the lowest of the low season. Late-January is all about the cyclones, and when you read any article about the best time of year to visit, you’ll always find it right at the bottom. It’s hot, it’s rainy, and everyone says to avoid visiting then.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I went anyway, and didn’t experience a single day of rain, although it was really freaking hot.;;;;;;;;;
My private balcony at my guesthouse, complete with lantern, hammock, and the sound of the crashing waves;;;;;;;;;
Most backpackers in Tofo opt to spend their nights at Fatima’s, and the majority of blog posts I’d read from people who have visited said it was the cheapest option in town. I’d originally planned to follow the crowd and rock up there, too, but after reading some shockingly bad reviews online, I opted to splurge instead.;;;;;;;;;
In Berlin last summer, I’d learned the importance of occasionally blowing my travel budget on a treat for myself, and Tofo now seemed like the perfect place to do so.;;;;;;;;;
Especially because, unlike Berlin, it was inexpensive and you could get a lot for your money.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For $65 a night, I opted to stay at the highly-reviewed Baia Sonambula, which is now one of my favourite guesthouses in the world.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I had a room with a private balcony, complete with sofa and hammock, with a view of the ocean. And whenever I chose to go to bed with the doors open, I’d fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean.;;;;;;;;;
Breakfasts were elaborate, fruit was never-ending, and every late-afternoon, after spending a day on the beach, I’d return to cakes freshly baked that day and an unlimited supply of coconut water.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One morning, I awoke to find an enormous beetle — maybe a cockroach — on the mosquito netting beside my face. Thankfully, it was the outside. Four inches in size, it was intimidating the hell out of me, and while I’ve become hardened to most bugs and cockroaches on my travels, this one was simply too big. I knew that if I left it in my room all day, I’d spend that night paranoid that it had somehow managed to get into my bed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When one of the staff members strolled past, I waved him over and began to apologise.;;;;;;;;;
“I feel like such a wimp, but um, there’s this very big bug in my room and it’s… scaring me. Can you help?”;;;;;;;;;
He grinned and wandered inside and over to where I was pointing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” he reassured me as he plucked it off with his thumb and forefinger. “It is not a venomous animal, so it’s okay.”;;;;;;;;;
He then stood in my room chatting to me for the next ten minutes while casually holding this enormous beetle between his fingers.;;;;;;;;;
That was embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The main reason for why the beach is so empty during the day is because Tofo attracts divers from all over the world, and I often felt like I was the only person who wasn’t there for the diving. It’s off the coast of Tofo that’s said to be one of the best places in the world to dive.;;;;;;;;;
Whale sharks, manta rays, humpback whales, dolphins, and more all call this coastline their permanent home, and boats head out daily to help travellers make their acquaintance.;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve been reading Never Ending Footsteps for a while, you’ll know that I’m both too scared to try diving, but hate snorkelling.;;;;;;;;;
Argh! Snorkelling! ;;;;;;;;;
I don’t get it. You know I don’t get it. I’ve never been able to do it without swallowing half the ocean, feeling nauseated, and then getting a headache for having my mask on too tight. Every time I’ve taken a snorkelling trip, I’ve ended it by vowing to never take one again.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But whale sharks! Manta rays! After five years of travel, these megafauna had somehow always alluded me. Probably because I hate snorkelling. I’d love to see them up close and Tofo is supposed to be the best and easiest place in the world to spot whale sharks.;;;;;;;;;
Should I hop on a boat and strap an awful mask to my face in search of these gentle giants of the sea?;;;;;;;;;
I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
My ocean safari was simultaneously the best, worst, and most terrifying snorkelling experience of my life, and I’ll save the full story for a future post.;;;;;;;;;
One thing I will say about it is that there’s an awful lot of ocean between Mozambique and Madagascar, and the waves were so violent that there were straps on the floor of the boat to keep you from falling out.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never felt so sick before in my life.;;;;;;;;;
But you should still totally do it if you get the opportunity.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Back on dry land, I couldn’t be happier.;;;;;;;;;
Like many beach paradises around the world that I’ve fallen in love with, I soon settled into a routine on Tofo that brought me nothing but joy.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
9 a.m.: After an indulgent lie-in, I would pull myself out of bed and onto the gorgeous guesthouse terrace. Breakfast was served for all of the guests here each morning, and it was always guaranteed to be an extravagant affair.;;;;;;;;;
I would usually opt for the fresh mango or passionfruit juice for my drink, then load up my plate with fruits and treats from the buffet table, depending on what’s on offer that day. Everything’s cooked fresh that morning, whether it’s bruschetta, egg tarts, homemade breads and jams, or a coconut muffin.;;;;;;;;;
From the menu, I’d often order the Mozambican version of the full-English breakfast, because I’m a stereotype when I travel, but I’d sometimes go for the apple and cinnamon pancakes if I was feeling like truly kicking my Whole30 diet in the balls.;;;;;;;;;
10 a.m.: Time for an early morning walk in an attempt to keep a small level of exercise in my life. Mornings were one of my favourite times to wander around the entire village in exactly three minutes. It was blissfully quiet then, with most tourists out on the dive boats and everyone else sleeping off their hangovers.;;;;;;;;;
11 a.m.: Beach time! I head down to the sand with a towel and my Kindle and lay out for a couple of hours to soak up the hot Mozambican sun. My refreshment is a giant coconut that I pay 50 cents for, and being in the middle of the low season, the touts become friends rather than aggressive hawkers. I sit and chat with them for most of the morning.;;;;;;;;;
1 p.m.: It’s time to find some lunch. I wander back into the village and stop at a shack that looks good. Most days I opt for seafood of some sort — I’m never too fussed what it is, as I know it’s guaranteed to be some of the best of my life, not costing me more than a few dollars.;;;;;;;;;
3 p.m.: Nothing happens quickly in Tofo, so by the time I’ve eaten, it’s mid-afternoon and I’m ready for a shower.;;;;;;;;;
4 p.m.: Afternoon tea is served at Baia Sonambula, so I pop over to the terrace with my laptop and grab several slices of the freshly-made cake, a large glass of coconut water, and sit on a sun lounger to answer a few emails. I’d planned to work while I was travelling in Mozambique, but I’m so impossibly relaxed that I can’t bring myself to write more than a few words each afternoon.;;;;;;;;;
6 p.m.: Sunset. I grab a cold 2M beer from the bar at my guesthouse and write in my diary while the sun sets in the distance. Eventually, the mosquitoes start to devour me and I head back to my room to bathe in repellent.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
7 p.m.: In the evenings, I’m always startled to discover how many people are actually in town. And that there’s a lively nightlife scene. There’s beach bars, live music, drinking, and dancing, but a more mellow scene, too, where you can sit down and chat with travellers from all over the world. There’s something about Mozambique that attracts hardcore adventurers to its shores, and there was always someone with an interesting story to talk to.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it came time to leave Tofo, I nearly didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
It’s the sort of place where travellers turn up for a few days, then leave a month later, if ever at all.;;;;;;;;;
I loved it. I loved my routine. I loved the beach. I loved dolphin-spotting from my balcony. I loved my guesthouse. I loved the seafood. I loved the friendly locals. I loved the fresh coconuts. I loved the break from work. I loved the slowed down way of life.;;;;;;;;;
In fact, I loved everything but the snorkelling.;;;;;;;;;
But is that really that much of a surprise?;;;;;;;;;
"Does Tofo sound like your kind of beach paradise?""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408119-436,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/15"",""Stepping Back in Time at Cahal Pech"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/cahal-pech/"",""Stepping Back in Time at Cahal Pech"",""May 14, 2020"",""It was my last full day in San Ignacio and I had a decision to make.";;;;;;;;;
I could either spend my day exploring the Actun Tunichil Muknal cave, taking a tour that involved hiking and crossing streams in order to make it to a cave full of skeletons and relics from over 1,000 years ago, or I could opt to stay in town, checking out the local market and hiking up to the Cahal Pech Mayan ruins.;;;;;;;;;
I opted for the latter, and my decision made sense for me at the time. The ATM cave tour was pricey at $100/person and Dave and I were already struggling to stay on budget in Belize. We knew we had an expensive year of travel ahead of us, too — a trip to Antarctica at the end of the year could easily add up to $10,000 each, so we were trying to focus on building our savings. Not only that, but while I was researching the tour, I learned that it would be strenuous (and I had mono/glandular fever at the time), that I’d be spending a lot of time in confined spaces in the dark, and that I wouldn’t be able to take any photos, so most likely wouldn’t write about it here.;;;;;;;;;
Having now had several friends visit the cave and name it the highlight of their time in Belize, I wish I had gone for it.;;;;;;;;;
But I didn’t.;;;;;;;;;
I went to Cahal Pech instead, and discovered yet another kickass set of Mayan ruins with nobody else around.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cahal Pech was even easier to get to than Xunantunich, as the ruins are located one mile outside of San Ignacio.;;;;;;;;;
One mile up a very steep hill.;;;;;;;;;
I was battling mono while I was in Belize, but had no idea at the time. It wasn’t until six weeks later, when I flew home and decided to see my doctor about my swollen glands, that I was diagnosed with it. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But I digress.;;;;;;;;;
The walk up the hill in the midday sun was a challenge for me, but I refused to get a taxi for just a one mile walk. That’s why many of the photos Dave took at the ruins show me sat on the ground and resting rather than exploring.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Sometimes I stood up, though.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cahal Pech means “Place of the ticks”, and it’s one of Belize’s oldest set of ruins. Dating from way back in 1200 B.C., it first functioned as a farm, then later as a hilltop home for for an elite Mayan family. At the height of its occupation, around 15,000 people lived there, with majority of them farmers living on the outskirts.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The ruins are nowhere near as spread out as Xunantunich, so you can easily see everything within an hour. There are seven small plazas to explore, and 30-odd Mayan structures, including temples, ball courts, a sweat house, and even a royal burial chamber.;;;;;;;;;
What made Cahal Pech different to the other Mayan ruins I’ve explored was that walking from plaza to plaza was like wandering through a maze. The entire complex was full of tunnels and passageways and dark rooms, with stairs connecting them to courtyards of different heights. It was kind of like wandering through a real-life Escher painting.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Once I regained my energy levels, I was ready to start exploring.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The first thing that struck me was that Cahal Pech was void of other tourists. I don’t think we saw a single other person for the entire duration of our stay, which made all the difference to me.;;;;;;;;;
There’s something so magical about wandering around ruins from thousands of years ago and having every single one of the structures to yourself. It makes it easier to sit and contemplate what the structures may have looked like back when tens of thousands of people would have called it home. To think about how every one of these structures would have been built and painted by hand.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One other thing I loved Cahal Pech is that it’s in a constant state of evolution. There’s still plenty of archaeological activity taking place even today as many parts of complex have yet to be excavated, artefacts are therefore still being discovered, and some of the ruins are in the process of being reconstructed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, Cahal Pech. Is it a must-see in Belize? Nope.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s a small site, so there isn’t a huge amount to explore, and I wouldn’t recommend going out of your way just to visit. There are more exciting Mayan ruins in Belize. But if you’re in San Ignacio already? It’s worth the effort to hike up the hill and spend an hour or so checking it out.;;;;;;;;;
After all, it’s not often you’ll get the opportunity to wander around a bunch of 3,000 year-old ruins and have them all to yourself.;;;;;;;;;
By this point on my trip, I have to confess that I was starting to feel ruined-out. By this point, I had the motivation to see one more Mayan ruin before calling it quits;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, I’d saved the best one for last.;;;;;;;;;
It was time to head into Guatemala.;;;;;;;;;

Today, I’m so excited to share with you my biggest travel highlights!";;;;;;;;;
2015 has been an odd year for me, but in a way, it’s also been one of the best. While much of the year was dominated by the dizzying highs of publishing a book, there were dozens of smaller moments that filled me with more happiness than I realised at the time. It’s been a fabulous year for travel and I end 2015 feeling excited and inspired for what lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;
From Cambodia to Cornwall; Latvia to Lake Como, here are my favourite moments of the year!;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Road Tripping My Way Around Cornwall;;;;;;;;;
I mean, just look at that beach!;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve got a trip to the U.K. coming up, you have to go to Cornwall. I spent ten days road tripping around this region and was blown away by how much it has to offer visitors. In fact, I loved it so much that I’m already in the planning stages of a second road trip for 2016!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Where to begin? The beaches are surprisingly great for England, although the ocean is, of course, freezing. There are beautiful hikes running all the way along the rugged coastline. No matter where you are, you’ll be looking at rolling hills, sand dunes, cute houses, or jagged cliffs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The laid-back lifestyle won my heart, too. It’s a place where good food, living well and surfing reign supreme, and the locals are so warm and welcoming.;;;;;;;;;
And I can’t talk about Cornwall and not mention the food. Cream teas with Cornish clotted cream. Fresh seafood. Fish and chips. Cornish pasties. I don’t think I’ve eaten as well anywhere else in the world. Who would have thought I’d end up saying that about somewhere in the UK?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Mounting Four Beasts in One Afternoon in Taipei;;;;;;;;;
For such a large city, Taipei surprised me with its numerous accessible hikes. From Taipei 101, you only need walk twenty minutes to be at the base of Elephant Mountain, with dozens of hiking trails stretching out before you. There are four main mountains in Taipei, each named after a different “beast”, and I spent much of my month in the city clambering all over them.;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The paths were well-paved, with plenty of small trails leading off into the distance, and if you walked for long enough, you’d find yourself treading above the clouds. I chose to hike in the middle of the day in the middle of the week, when the paths were blissfully quiet. It was common to walk for half an hour without seeing another person, and when I did, it was nearly always an incredibly fit local who looked as though they’d been running up these mountains for the better part of a century.;;;;;;;;;
It was these walks that helped lessen the anxiety I’d been battling for most of the year. They made me feel strong. They gave me a chance to throw on my headphones, take my mind off of everything, and concentrate on my feet.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Running So Far Out of My Comfort Zone;;;;;;;;;
I’ve never, ever been a runner, but after finishing my book, I was losing my mind. Or, at least, that’s the only explanation I have for signing up to join a running tour of Maastricht. You know, that place I visited immediately after spending three months walking no more than 30 metres a day?;;;;;;;;;

What was I thinking?;;;;;;;;;
It was so hard. I had no fitness whatsoever, and our guide was definitely perplexed by me, but damnit, motherfucker, I was going to finish the tour. And so I ran the hell out of that five kilometre route in — cough — ninety minutes, and I was bursting with euphoria as I did so.;;;;;;;;;
I was a runner! I was a really fast runner!;;;;;;;;;
So I bought tickets for a five kilometre colour run for a month later. As I said: losing my mind.;;;;;;;;;
And somehow, I made it through that, and I didn’t come last, despite not running once since Maastricht. I felt amazing again!;;;;;;;;;
I used to hate running because I sucked at it, but once I started thinking of it as a fun activity rather than something that will make me want to die, I found myself enjoying every minute. Conquering your fears always feels amazing!;;;;;;;;;

Touring the Beautiful Douro Valley;;;;;;;;;
The Douro Valley easily wins a top three ranking on my list of the most beautiful places I visited this year.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
While the scenery was one of the main draws for me, the highlight had to be spending an afternoon touring some of the best producers of port wine in the area and sampling dozens of glasses. I learned so much about the different types of port (mostly that it’s impossible to find one I don’t like), and could have easily spent thousands hundreds of euros if Dave hadn’t been there to talk me back down. I love port!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So many people visit this area as a day trip from Porto, but the next time I’m in Portugal, I’m going to make like a couple we met at a tasting: take a week-long road trip around the valley to soak up as much of the port region as possible.;;;;;;;;;

Getting Caught Up in a Rainstorm at Keukenhof;;;;;;;;;
I was mildly excited to learn we’d be in the Netherlands at the right time of year to catch the famous tulip displays at Keukenhof. Flowers aren’t really my kind of thing, so while I appreciated the beauty of the colourful tulips I was a little underwhelmed.;;;;;;;;;
That is, until we took a boat tour of the gardens. A dozen of us clambered on board the small open-air boat and set off just as the sky turned black: the weather had transformed from bright blue skies to thunderclouds within minutes. Our driver merely chuckled and we continued on.;;;;;;;;;
It was just as we reached as far as we could possibly get from dry land when the heavens opened. And it poured. A thousand painful droplets pounded down on our heads as everyone began to scream.;;;;;;;;;
It was hilarious!;;;;;;;;;
We were half an hour from shelter, on a river, in the middle of these beautiful tulip fields and everyone was drenched. I couldn’t wipe the grin from my face.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and then a woman dropped her bottle overboard so we had to turn back around to find it. But nobody could see it because there was so much rain, so we were sat floating for a good ten minutes, squealing and searching for a stupid water bottle in the murky, choppy waters, raindrops splattering against our faces.;;;;;;;;;
Something about massive rainstorms where you’re immediately drenched and can’t do anything about it fill me with so much joy. It’s a weird thing to count as a travel highlight, but it was hilarious and I hadn’t felt that alive in a long time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Living With Locals Beside Lake Como;;;;;;;;;
A clear sign that I’m having the time of my life? When I leave a place and realise I didn’t take a single photo.;;;;;;;;;
A week in the tiny village of Piazzaga was just what I needed in the days following my book launch. The towns around Lake Como can be incredibly touristy — our day trip to Bellagio had us wincing and heading for the next ferry out of there — so I was overjoyed when Dave introduced me to his friends who own a restaurant in a village with a population in the single figures.;;;;;;;;;
We spent our days hanging out in the restaurant, drinking wine and people watching as the locals passed through, playing Exploding Kittens for hours on end, and eating some of the best, freshest food of my life. The pasta! The tomatoes! The cheese! The meat! The wine! I loved every moment.;;;;;;;;;

Falling in Love with Thai Food in Bangkok;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I aren’t huge fans of Bangkok — in fact, we’re not really fans at all — but when we discovered some of our friends would be in the city at the same time, we immediately booked flights to hang out with them.;;;;;;;;;
The neighbourhood we were staying in was my kind of place. A place where there are so few tourists. Where the only thing to do is eat. So that’s exactly what we did.;;;;;;;;;
Before this trip to Bangkok, I firmly believed I would never like Thai food. I don’t have a huge tolerance to heat, I despise all nuts, and I’m not a fan of coconut. So, uh, that massively limits me in what I can eat, and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve ordered a dish in Thailand only to find that, surprise! It was smothered in peanuts or chillies.;;;;;;;;;
But this time around, I had Jodi as my guide, and she knew exactly where to take me. By the time we left the city, ten days later, I was obsessed with Thai food and excitedly talking about the potential of spending several months living in Bangkok so that I could cram as many pad pongalis into my mouth as humanly possible.;;;;;;;;;

Basing My Travels Around Seeing Friends;;;;;;;;;
2015 was all about the people. After four years of prioritising the places I’ve most wanted to visit, these days I’m focusing more on where my friends are and how I can see them. And because many of my friends also work online, it means we can spend so more quality time together — lunch dates and coffee catch ups and work days and blogger dinners.;;;;;;;;;
At the start of the year, we moved to Granada because our friends Dan and Lindsay couldn’t stop raving about it, and while we were there, we took a bus up to Madrid to spend time with Diana, and catch up with Craig and Linda. Then, when our time in Spain drew to a close, we flew to the Netherlands to see Dave’s brother, catching up with Julia and Scott, and spending a sunny afternoon on Yvette’s boat, in the process.;;;;;;;;;
Later on in the year, we moved to Madrid for six weeks after learning how many travel bloggers would be in town that summer. For a blissful few weeks, we got to talk travel blogging business with Diana and Will and Matt and Sam and Audrey.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it came to Southeast Asia, we flew to Bangkok to spend time with Jodi, James, Stuart, and Diana (yep, this was definitely the Year of Diana!), then we moved on to Cambodia, making sure to time our visit to Siem Reap with Chris and Stephen. After showing Dave’s parents around Vietnam, we rounded off the year with a catch up with Tom in Taipei, and pub drinks with Torre in Melbourne.;;;;;;;;;
As much as I’m looking forward to finding a base so that I can surround myself with a constant set of people to hang out with, I can’t deny that basing my location around where my friends are feels amazing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Cafe Hopping Around Hanoi;;;;;;;;;
It’s always the way: I arrived in Hanoi fully expecting to dislike it then fell head over heels in love. So many people complain that Hanoi is too chaotic, the people aren’t friendly, it’s full of scams, but my experience couldn’t have been more different.;;;;;;;;;
I loved the chaos; it made me feel alive. But most of all, I loved the cafe scene, and spent my five days in the city hunting down propaganda-themed cafes and expat haunts. I always thought Saigon was my kind of place in Vietnam, but Hanoi is starting to edge it out. The streets full of nothing but hipster cafes have a lot to do with it.;;;;;;;;

Sleeping in the Jungle in Cambodia;;;;;;;;;
What a cool and unusual experience!;;;;;;;;;
Our three nights spent relaxing on the Tatai River in Cambodia were some of my favourite of the entire year.;;;;;;;;;
We were staying in a floating bungalow in the middle of the jungle, a thirty minute boat ride from the nearest village and Internet connection. Each morning, we’d dive off our balcony into the river, then spend the rest of our day doing some kind of water-based activity. I loved spending our afternoons tubing downstream with a cold can of Angkor Beer in hand, and the cruise we took one night ranked up there as showing me one of the best sunsets of my life.;;;;;;;;;
But what really made the stay perfect was the staff at our hotel. When the excursion we wanted to take wasn’t running, they gave us a free sunset cruise to make up for it. When construction was taking place in the room next to ours, they offered us a free meal. When it was time to move on, they waited for the bus with us, then gave the driver a note, asking him to call ahead to book a minivan for our next leg of the journey. When I splash out on an expensive hotel, I expect to feel as though I’m being ripped off and charged for every little expense, but it was the complete opposite here.;;;;;;;;;

Forming an Indulgent Routine on Otres Beach;;;;;;;;;
Otres Beach is a favourite haunt of mine, and I was relieved to return this year and discover that it hadn’t changed. Our style of accommodation, however, had. We were in the highest-rated place on the beach for Dave’s birthday, and we took to making our stay one of our most indulgent.;;;;;;;;;
Each morning, we awoke to a breakfast of fresh coconut juice and tropical fruits, then immediately after finishing, walked ten metres from the restaurant into the warm ocean. Back at the hotel, we would spend our mornings lazing by the pool and reading books, and our afternoons wandering the length of the beach. Dinner was often pizza at Papa Pippos — one of our favourite restaurants — and we rounded off our evenings with a moonlit paddle in the ocean. It was the perfect daily routine!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Walking the Walls of Angkor Thom;;;;;;;;;
Our tuk-tuk driver at Angkor was bemused. No matter how many times we had told him we wanted to see the temples without people, he kept parking up in front of them. When he dropped us off in front of the Bayon, he frowned when we turned on our hells and walked in the opposite direction.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We kept going until we found one of the gates to Angkor Thom, then clambered up the eight metre wall to reach the top. To walk the entire circumference of the walls, we’d be clocking up twelve kilometres, so we set about walking a quarter.;;;;;;;;;
And for the hour that we walked, we didn’t see a single person. A few kilometres from us was one of the most popular temples at Angkor, yet nobody was where we were. It makes sense: from a tourist perspective there wasn’t much to see, but from a Lauren perspective, it was heaven.;;;;;;;;;
As we dawdled along the edges, surrounded by butterflies and vines, and overlooking the chocolate-brown river, Dave and I got to properly talk without distractions for the first time in a few months. We spent the time daydreaming about what we want for our future base and our upcoming travel plans. We chatted about Dave’s life-changing experience on the Camino and how I was slowly starting to conquer my anxiety. It was a beautiful moment made even more enjoyable by the solitude.;;;;;;;;;

An Anniversary Celebration in Taipei;;;;;;;;;
When I got dunk and sent this guy a DM on Twitter all those countries ago, I never imagined that four years later we’d still be together. It’s been a wonderful experience: Dave has been my cheerleader, my confidant, and my confidence booster, pushing me out of my comfort zone when I most needed it and least wanted to, but always being there to help pick me up when I fall. I’m a lucky girl!;;;;;;;;;
Our anniversary celebration was the perfect slice of normality: smoked salmon eggs benedict at our favourite brunch place, watching James Bond at the cinema, stuffing our faces with mango shaved ice, taking an afternoon nap, and heading out for delicious Indian food in the evening.;;;;;;;;;
Honestly, I know it sounds like a really mundane day, but that’s what made it such a highlight. Now that travel is my new normal, spending a day living a “regular life” now feels like a novelty. Not only that, but it also showed us that finding a base is definitely the right for us — we couldn’t stop talking about how great that day was all month!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Falling in Love With Olives in Granada;;;;;;;;;
I’m been a hater of olives for as long as I can remember. I despised them. They were weird and salty and had a strange texture and were far too strong for my tastebuds to handle. They were the absolute worst.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We joined a 21-course tasting meal at La Oliva in Granada, and I was horrified when one of the first dishes was a small tray of olives. I pulled a face at Dave, knowing I’d have to try one because I didn’t want to offend.;;;;;;;;;
I popped it in my mouth and frowned because it was delicious. Dave would later tell me that it was one of the most mild olives he’d ever tasted, but it turned out that that was just what I needed to get me on the olive ladder of success. Because now that I’d found an olive I liked, I could begin my climb. And that’s exactly what I did.;;;;;;;;;
I started by having one whenever Dave ordered some. When we travelled around Cornwall, I tentatively tried a few more. In Madrid, I started ordering them as a starter for all of my meals, and now, in Melbourne, I just visited a Spanish restaurant and filled my stomach with a super-strong olive/anchovy/chilli concoction that was mind-blowingly tasty.;;;;;;;;;
These days, I’ve evolved from the pickiest eater you’d have ever met to someone who genuinely can’t think of a single thing she wouldn’t try, so much so that it’s hard to find any kind of food that challenges me anymore. That’s why falling in love with olives made me so happy. One of my remaining barriers to liking all food: removed!;;;;;;;;;

Finding Solo Travel Confidence in Riga;;;;;;;;;
I loved Riga! What a cool, underrated city. But what was so wonderful about my time in Latvia was travelling solo for the first time in over a year and discovering how much confidence I’d gained.;;;;;;;;;
After writing a post about how I hate eating alone, in Riga, I found myself wondering why I had made such a big deal out of it. I ate out for every meal there and loved every second of it. I was ordering three dishes to sample as much of the local food as possible without feeling shame for having a small appetite; I was asking waitresses for their recommendations; I was lingering over my meal for an hour without feeling embarrassed.;;;;;;;
But not only that, I did things I’d normally have shied away from as a solo traveller. I took free walking tours, and chatted to locals, and asked for directions, and took weird Snapchat videos of me singing in the streets, sunbathed in parks, and wandered inside random buildings.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Riga helped me realise that I wasn’t a terrible solo traveller, which was something I had always feared. All I had to do was worry less about what other people were thinking about me. Riga was great for showing me I was finally getting there.;;;;;;;;;
"And those were my highlights of 2015! Stay tuned: next week, I’ll be sharing my 15 lowlights! What were your travel highlights of the year?""";;;;;;;;;

When my time in Seattle drew to a close, I left having fallen even deeper in love with this city and longing for a visa that would allow both me and Dave to settle in the Pacific Northwest. For now, though, that wasn’t an option, so it was time to keep moving.;;;;;;;;;
My family were flying out to New Orleans for my dad’s birthday, and we had a music-themed trip on the agenda to celebrate.;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and during our layover in Denver, I spotted one of these anxiety-inducing signs for the first time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
First up on our trip: crazy, chaotic New Orleans.;;;;;;;;;
And I liked it so much more than I was expecting to!;;;;;;;;;
We filled out our days with tourist activities and our evenings with music, heading for Frenchmen street for burgers and cocktails, then bar-hopping our way down from there, stopping anywhere with guitars and harmonicas (and in one case, tapdancing) ringing out into the night.;;;;;;;;;
New Orleans was beautiful, it was loud, it was so much fun, and it made me feel alive. I would definitely return.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Of course, I couldn’t visit Louisiana and not check out the nearby swamps! And who knew that swamps could be so beautiful?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t get enough of the murky, chocolate-brown water, the eerie cypress trees dangling overhead, and the dangerous wildlife lurking in the water. We were fortunate enough to spot multiple alligators and snakes on our trip, with a particular highlight being the eight-foot long alligator that dragged itself out of the water to a path mere metres from our boat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We dragged ourselves from New Orleans and drove across Mississippi to Memphis, for a stop that was all about the music and the history.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Evenings spent stuffing my face with ribs on Beale Street, a day wandering around cheesy, tacky Graceland, learning more about Elvis at Sun Studios, and a sobering but important visit to the Civil Rights Museum.;;;;;;;;;
I hadn’t heard great things about Memphis before arriving, and I’m not sure that I’d return after seeing a lot of the touristy stuff, but I really enjoyed my time there. It’s a really cool city and I definitely didn’t feel like I was in any danger of being killed, like I’d expected to.;;;;;;;;;
Fun fact: Memphis has the best tasting tap water I’ve ever experienced!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
From the blues of Memphis to the country music of Nashville.;;;;;;;;;
Where I soon learned that I don’t like country music.;;;;;;;;;
Here, we went to the Johnny Cash Museum (so good!), the Country Music Hall of Fame (boring!), and, um, oh, I guess that was it for music-themed activities. I was bit burnt out by this point.;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I loved Nashville, though, and especially hipster East Nashville, which was full of delicious food and great bars. I loved it so much that I’d even consider moving there one day!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You want to know what’s a good sign I really like a place? If I take no photos of it.;;;;;;;;;
Which is kind of a rubbish thing to do when you’re a travel blogger.;;;;;;;;;
But when I don’t take any photos of a place it’s because I’m too busy having fun. It’s because I want to fully enjoy my surroundings without worrying about recording them. It’s because I feel like I belong and that I’m just living my life.;;;;;;;;;
Miami, the next stop on our U.S. trip, was that place for me. We were there as a surprise treat for Dave — I wanted to thank him for the huge amount of support and love he’d shown me during my recent battles with anxiety, so I splurged on a kickass Airbnb on South Beach and tickets to see Pearl Jam, his favourite band, play!;;;;;;;;;
I loved Miami! I loved the beaches, the incredible food scene, the warm weather, the Art Deco architecture, and the friendly people. I would totally return once a year for some beach fun in the future!;;;;;;;;;

    ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
So, thank you, Pearl Jam, for bringing me to Miami, as I probably wouldn’t have otherwise visited!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Next, we jumped on a plane from Miami to Lisbon with no idea what to expect.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
We booked an Airbnb apartment for a month with the aim of either starting apartment hunting or moving on to our second (Berlin) or third (Amsterdam) options to see if those works for us. Exciting times!;;;;;;;;;

Highlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Memphis evenings on Beale Street with my family!;;;;;;;;;
Lowlight of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Being in pain for the vast majority of my family road trip in the U.S.;;;;;;;;;
Sadly, an infection I battled in Seattle left me with some kind of permanent damage that resulted in me being in the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. Constantly.;;;;;;;;;
As much as I tried to throw myself fully into the family fun and games, there was definitely a part of me that just wanted to lie in bed and cry forever.;;;;;;;;;
Incident of the Month;;;;;;;;;
Tornadogate.;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I were staying in a small wooden shed-type apartment in Memphis, and one night, as we were about to fall asleep, Dave’s phone buzzed to life to tell us a tornado warning had been issued for our location.;;;;;;;;;
Oh my god.;;;;;;;;;
I did what I always do when I’m terrified and got straight on Twitter. Searching for “Memphis tornado” brought up a lot of tweets from panicking locals who were packing their emergency evacuation kits and preparing for a potential night in their shelters. I turned to google and began to research what to do in a tornado.;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I packed our bags and left them by the door, and while he soundly slept, I sat upright in bed, fully-clothed and waiting for the sirens to sound.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Fortunately, they didn’t, but man, what a scary experience! It certainly put me off ever wanting to live somewhere that experiences frequent tornadoes!;;;;;;;;;

Neither of us do things by halves. If we find something we love, we’re either all in, 100%, or we just don’t care.;;;;;;;;;
There was the time I developed an obsession with LOST and skipped three weeks of lectures at college because I couldn’t tear myself away from my laptop. The time I fell in love with Pink Floyd and spent thousands of pounds buying rare vinyls and following touring band members around the world. The time I realised that having a skincare and makeup routine stops my panic attacks, so spent a serious chunk of change at Sephora. Oh, and the time I fell in love with travel and spent the past five years exploring the world. Cough.;;;;;;;;;
And my dad is exactly the same.;;;;;;;;;
His obsessions, though? They revolve around listening to music at every possible opportunity, collecting vinyl for his jukebox, and gazing lovingly at said jukebox.;;;;;;;;;
My dad inspecting his vinyl haul after a day of record shop-hopping in Memphis;;;;;;;;;
So naturally, when his 60th birthday rolled around, my family all pulled together to plan a kickass music-themed birthday trip for him. We all managed to score a couple of weeks off work, then led him to his business class seat and whisked him away on a one-way ticket to New Orleans.;;;;;;;;;
It was time to get our music on.;;;;;;;;;
And what a great trip we had. Our two weeks were spent travelling around the American South, catching great live music, visiting fantastic museums, wandering around fun cities, and eating so. much. food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ve got a ton of posts coming up over the next few weeks about our trip, but for now, enjoy this overview of my new favourite region of the United States.;;;;;;;;;
Typical New Orleans architecture;;;;;;;;;
New Orleans Nights on Frenchmen Street;;;;;;;;;
New Orleans: what a pleasant surprise!;;;;;;;;;
I’ll be honest with you, despite knowing so many people who have fallen in love with the Big Easy, I wasn’t expecting it to be my jam. I thought it’d be loud and brash and full of partiers and, well, that’s just not my kind of scene.;;;;;;;;;
And man, was I wrong.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I loved New Orleans! I loved the friendly locals, the gorgeous architecture, the music spilling out from every door, the amazing food scene… and on Frenchmen Street, I really fell in love. That was where we found the New Orleans that was my dad’s idea of heaven.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So every night, we fled Bourbon Street for Frenchmen, heading for burgers and cocktails at Port of Call, then bar-hopped our way down the street, stopping anywhere with guitars and harmonicas (and in one case, tapdancing, pictured above) ringing out into the night.;;;;;;;;;
Swampy Slidell;;;;;;;;;
Alligator-Spotting on a Louisiana Swamp Tour;;;;;;;;;
Of course, our trip through the South couldn’t be just about the music!;;;;;;;;;
Because then my mum and sister would have been really bored.;;;;;;;;;
On the second day of our trip, we doused ourselves in bug spray and headed over to Slidell for a two-hour bayou experience around Honey Island Swamp.;;;;;;;;;
And who knew that swamps could be so beautiful? I couldn’t get enough of the murky, chocolate-brown water, the eerie cypress trees dangling overhead, and the dangerous wildlife lurking in the water. We were fortunate enough to spot multiple alligators and snakes on our trip, with a particular highlight being the eight-foot long alligator that dragged itself out of the water to a path mere metres from our boat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Boozy Introduction to the New Orlean’s History;;;;;;;;;
My birthday present to my dad was signing the entire family up for a cocktail tour around New Orleans, which aims to teach you about the city’s history through its most famous drinks.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And it was just as fun as it sounds.;;;;;;;;;
This was one of my favourite activities in New Orleans, and I loved getting to check out some amazing, quirky bars (the one pictured above had a circular bar that rotates like a carousel!), try some interesting cocktails, and learn about how alcohol had such a big influence on the city.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Long Drive Across Mississippi;;;;;;;;;
It wouldn’t be a road trip without a really long day of driving, and that took place in Mississippi for us.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And guys, did we screw up with this. Rather than doing our research and realising we could make our way from New Orleans to Memphis via highway 61, otherwise known as the Blues Highway, the road where people like B.B. King, Muddy Waters, and Howlin’ Wolf grew up beside, we took the quickest route Google Maps showed us and ended up with an incredibly boring drive instead.;;;;;;;;;
Groan.;;;;;;;;;
If I could do this trip again, I’d choose to work in an overnight stay in Clarksdale, so that we could do the route justice.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Ribs, Ribs, and Even More Ribs in Memphis;;;;;;;;;
After our first night in Memphis, my entire family swore we would never eat ribs outside of Memphis again. Nothing could ever come close!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So we decided to make the most of our time in the city and had ribs for practically every meal we could. My favourite ones were at Blues City Cafe, with my meal at B.B. King’s Blues Club coming in at a close second.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Getting Our Tourist On at Graceland;;;;;;;;;
Yep, we did it. We went to Graceland.;;;;;;;;;
And it was just as, um… unique as I’d expected. But Elvis runs in the blood of the Juliffs so there was a deeper meaning in visiting. My dad’s mum was crazy about him and ran his UK fan club for many, many years. My dad was brought up on Elvis and his childhood home had always been full of rare records and signed memorabilia from The King.;;;;;;;;;
There’s that Juliff obsession again.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So I can’t mock our visit too much. It was interesting, it was tacky, and, at times, it was sad. And there were a lot of crazy Elvis fans in our midst.;;;;;;;;;
Caressing Elvis’ microphone;;;;;;;;;
Sun Studio for Even More Elvis;;;;;;;;;
I firmly believe that an enthusiastic tour guide can make the most boring subject fascinating, and we definitely lucked out with our guide at Sun Studio. Her passion for music was infectious, and she had us all in the palm of her hand as she spoke about the amazing list of artists who had recorded here, took us around the recording studio, let us fondle Elvis’ microphone, and played us some unheard recordings from impromptu jam sessions that had been held there by Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Falling in Love With Beale Street;;;;;;;;;
I realise that hanging out on Beale Street for the vast majority of our time in Memphis was probably the most touristy thing we could have done, but hey, it was a lot of fun. And also, we’re tourists.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I loved the bright flashing lights, the blues music ringing out from every bar, the stores selling vinyl and guitars, and the ribs, of course. What a fun place to hang out!;;;;;;;;;
I got to design my own album cover at the Country Music Hall of Fame!;;;;;;;;;
Country Music Everything in Nashville;;;;;;;;;
By this point, we’d experienced the heart of jazz, blues, and rock and roll in New Orleans and Memphis, and it was now time to get our country on in Nashville.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And it was at the Country Music Hall of Fame that I discovered that, 1) I have no idea what country music actually is and it definitely isn’t Carrie Underwood or Florida Georgia Line, and 2) I don’t really like country music.;;;;;;;;;
That wasn’t a huge success and honestly, Dave and I spent a vast amount of our time at the Hall of Fame staring at exhibits of people we’d never heard of. And we then quickly shot down our idea of an evening at the Grand Ole Opry.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Johnny Cash Love;;;;;;;;;
We visited a ton of music-themed museums on this trip, but my absolute favourite has to be the Johnny Cash museum. And I’m not even much of a Johnny Cash fan!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s rare that I’d splash out $20 on a museum on somebody I don’t really care about, but it was so well done that I thoroughly enjoyed myself nonetheless. There was a ton of cool memorabilia, lots of interactive exhibits, and even a few handwritten letters that had me giggling at his jokes.;;;;;;;;;
I don’t have any photos of East Nashville, so here’s one of the downtown area, which was full of cowboy boots stores!;;;;;;;;;
East Nashville Love;;;;;;;;;
We lucked out with our stay in the city and scored an Airbnb apartment in hipster East Nashville, which immediately had us talking about how we could totally live in this area one day.;;;;;;;;;
It reminded me a lot of my favourite neighbourhood in Portland, OR. Lots of amazing food, friendly locals, and more of a laidback, residential feel. I loved it and would totally stay in this part of Nashville again!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Pearl Jam Finale in Miami;;;;;;;;;
I’d been planning it for months: ever since one of my friends liked an update from Pearl Jam on Facebook about their upcoming U.S. tour.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Pearl Jam is Dave’s favourite band, so I jotted down the date tickets went on sale, and woke up at 4 a.m. in Fiji to grab a couple as a surprise for him. Success!;;;;;;;;;
We spent an incredible week in Miami, staying in an amazing apartment on South Beach and spending our time relaxing on the beach or snapping photos of the art deco buildings. And then seeing Pearl Jam. Which Dave said was probably the best Pearl Jam show he’d seen.;;;;;;;;;
The perfect end to a perfect trip!;;;;;;;;;
My Introduction to the American South;;;;;;;;;
What a fantastic part of the U.S.! I warmed to the South in a way I wasn’t expecting and I’m already plotting my return.;;;;;;;;;
And honestly, the only downside, which wasn’t much of a downside, was the food. The food was so rich and so heavy, and I was so determined to try it all, that by the end of the trip, I felt constantly nauseated and was craving carrots.;;;;;;;;;
Everything else was wonderful!;;;;;;;;;
Oh, aside from that night when there was a tornado warning in Memphis and we were staying in an Airbnb apartment that was about as sturdy as a shed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

Coming up over the next month: a deeper look at my road trip!;;;;;;;;;
"Does this sound like your kind of trip? Let me know what you think of it in the comments!""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408030-410,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/18"",""How to Travel Bora Bora on a Budget: It’s Possible!"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/bora-bora-on-a-budget/"",""How to Travel Bora Bora on a Budget: It’s Possible!"",""March 24, 2021"",""When I was planning my South Pacific island-hopping adventure, I knew it wasn’t going to be cheap.";;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Unsurprisingly, the South Pacific is home to some of the priciest places on the planet; none more so than Bora Bora. This paradise island regularly tops lists of the most expensive honeymoon destinations in the world and during my research, I kept reading that prices range from “expensive” to “indescribably expensive”.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Challenge accepted.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite things to do when I travel is to shatter misconceptions about places around the world. I love going to destinations that have a reputation for being expensive and sharing exactly how you can visit for far cheaper.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Knowing that Bora Bora had such a high-end reputation was pulling me towards it. I immediately booked a one-way ticket to paradise, then set about figuring out how on earth I would be able to visit without spending all of my savings.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So can you visit Bora Bora on a budget?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Absolutely! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was surprised by how easy it is to do so. After booking my flight, I jumped online, sorted the nightly accommodation prices on Booking.com from low to high and was greeted with several guesthouses and hotels for well under $100 per person per night. A quick google of affordable guesthouses on the island brought up even more options that weren’t listed online — there were dozens of well-reviewed places for as little as $50 a night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And Airbnb! Airbnb is my secret weapon when it comes to finding affordable accommodation on Bora Bora — there’s a dozen guesthouses and homestays listed on the site for less than $100 a night. And they all receive exceptional reviews! Fill in the dates you want to visit here and check out how affordable the prices can be. Yep — I was blown away when I discovered there are guesthouses on the island for just $33 a night! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Who knew Bora Bora could be so inexpensive? I certainly didn’t! ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I’ll address this point now, because it always comes up whenever I talk about visiting stereotypically expensive places, like the Maldives or the Cook Islands, on a budget — this is not Southeast Asia cheap. You won’t find hostels and guesthouses for $1 a night, and likewise, you won’t find any street food for $1 a meal. If that’s your budget, the South Pacific isn’t for you.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But that doesn’t mean it’s ridiculously expensive, either.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Bora Bora, a typical budget for a shoestring traveler is $20 a day. If you’re a budget traveler, you’ll spend no more than $500 for a week-long stay on the island. Don’t believe people who say it’s impossible to visit Bora Bora on a budget or that you need to use points and miles in order to score a bargain — it’s not true and budget travel is very easy to do here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Let’s get into the details.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite views on Bora Bora: this is what you’ll see when you exit the airport on the island;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How to Get to Bora Bora Affordably;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Your biggest expense when it comes to Bora Bora will most likely be the flights to get there. I don’t collect points or miles, so my guide is for those of you who don’t have a ton of miles to blow on the flight. If you do, use them! If you don’t, don’t let this put you off.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My biggest and best advice of all is to start checking Secret Flying religiously. This website is my holy grail when it comes to travel deals and it’s thanks to them that I managed to score return flights from Lisbon to Cape Town for 280 USD, Rome to Japan for 350 USD, and one-way flights from Copenhagen to Los Angeles for 120 USD, along with Singapore to London for 102 USD. They’re totally legit and regularly share deals they’ve spotted for Bora Bora, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I write this right now (April 2019), they’re actually sharing a deal from U.S. cities to Tahiti for just 450 USD return, which is an incredible price!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If Secret Flying isn’t showing anything you can fit in with your schedule, I recommend heading to Skyscanner next. Search from your destination to Papeete over the space of the month you want to visit, and you’ll be able to make sure you are flying on the cheapest dates. It’s worth search for flights departing from the country you live in rather than your closest airport, too. You may find it works out to be many hundreds of dollars cheaper to fly out of a different airport that’s still within driving distance, for example.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re in Oceania, flights are going to be cheapest for you. From Australia (east coast) and New Zealand, flights to Tahiti start from $300 one-way, and if you’re already hanging out in the South Pacific, they’re just as affordable. I paid $356 for my flight from Rarotonga, in the Cook Islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’re hanging out in Southeast Asia, the cheapest way to get there is to take a flight to Australia for a hundred dollars or so with a budget airport and then onwards to Tahiti. Definitely make sure to check Secret Flying and Skyscanner if you’re in Southeast Asia, as you can regularly get from there to Australia for $100 each way.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
French Polynesia is a French territory, rather than its own separate country, so European readers will most likely find the cheapest flights from Paris, but it’s worth check places further east, like Turkey, as well.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
North American readers: the best way for you to get to Bora Bora cheaply is via San Francisco. French Bee flies there direct for $370 each way, which is a pretty great deal!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I also want to mention that if you’re planning on taking a round-the-world trip, you should be able to work French Polynesia into your itinerary without a problem. Several of the travellers I met in the region were there as part of their round-the-world ticket, so it’s definitely something to look into for a stopover.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Most of the deals and routes mentioned above will get you to Papeete, on Tahiti, which is the main airport in French Polynesia. From there, you’ll need to take a 30-minute flight to Bora Bora — a flight that I have to confess is annoyingly expensive.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ll be looking at around $200 each way for the 30-minute flight, but before you give up and decide to go somewhere else, there is a way to drastically cut down the amount you pay for your flights.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I picked up an island hopping pass from Air Tahiti, which gave me a 60% discount on what I would have paid if I’d booked all of my flights individually. Rather than just visiting Bora Bora, I flew from Tahiti to Maupiti, Raiatea, Huahine, Bora Bora, and back to Tahiti over the space of two weeks. For this, I ended up paying $400 for seven flights to five islands, including Bora Bora. That makes my flights into and out of Bora Bora just $60 each way.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

If you only want to visit Bora Bora, this isn’t super helpful, but I will say that I loved travelling around the Society Islands, and if you have a couple of weeks, it’s well worth checking out many of the islands, like I did. Maupiti is just like Bora Bora used to be 50 years ago and Huahine ended up being my favourite island in the South Pacific. It’s definitely worth considering some of the other nearby islands, as you’ll gain more value for your money.;;;;;;;;;

Staying on Bora Bora for Cheap;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I stayed at Villa Temanuata for $65 a night and it offered great value for money. The owners were friendly and helpful, the guests had access to a private beach in front of the bungalows, and it was a five-minute walk away from Matira Beach — the best beach on the main island. They offered a free pickup from the ferry terminal, had decent reviews, and had lots of options for activities. The rooms were basic, but clean. The only downside was that the Wi-Fi wasn’t working while I was there.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, they’ve recently increased their prices.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are still several budget guesthouses on the island that get good reviews. Check out Sunset Hill Lodge and Villa Rea Hanaa for doubles/quads starting at $120 a night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I mentioned above, there are Couchsurfing hosts on Bora Bora, so if you want to travel on a super-tight budget, that’s definitely a route to go down. Couchsurfing isn’t my kind of thing, so I didn’t try it out, but there are 40-odd hosts on the site.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finally, if you don’t mind some hassle when making your reservation, you can camp on Bora Bora for $15-20 a night. The campsite has a terrible website that hasn’t been updated in years and the only way to make a reservation is by phone. It sounds great based on the TripAdvisor reviews, but there’s very little information about it available elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Airbnb is another great option for Bora Bora, if not the best option overall. There are 40 rentals listed for under $100 a night, and 27 for under $50 a night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You can even stay in a guesthouse for just $33 a night there! For my next trip to Bora Bora, I’d probably go down the Airbnb route to save as much money as possible. Plus, this particular place sounds like such an epic way to see the island — you’ll be hanging out with locals, been shown their Bora Bora, and learning more than you would in those overpriced overwater bungalows. ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Transportation in Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bora Bora’s airport is located on a motu — a reef island — so to get to the mainland, you’ll need to jump on Air Tahiti’s free catamaran shuttle. It takes you directly to the dock in Vaitape, which is the main town on the island. From there, someone from your guesthouse will most likely pick you up — this is usually free, but make sure to check before making your booking, as you don’t want to be caught out with any unexpected costs when you arrive.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The easiest way to get around is to rent a bicycle. I paid $15 a day to hire mine, but saw signs for $10 around the island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are rumours of a bus that runs from Vaitape to Matira Beach and back every hour for $4.75, but I never saw it. It’s definitely worth asking around at your guesthouse for more information, though, as this can definitely help keep your costs low.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Taxis are crazy-expensive on the island, so avoid those. And car rentals, too. The mainland is 18 miles in circumference, so you could easily cycle or scooter your way around in a day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

The Cost of Activities in Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

There are plenty of things you can do on the island without spending too much money.;;;;;;;;;

If you’re going to do an island-hopping trip around several of the Society Islands, as I recommended, you may want to do save your activities for the other islands you’re going to be visiting. Lagoon cruises are just as amazing on Maupiti, for example, and you’ll be paying far less for them than you would on Bora Bora. If you’re only heading to Bora Bora and you’re determined to make the most of your trip, here are some suggestions:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
One of my favourite (and totally free) activities was heading to the Intercontinental Hotel (on Matira Beach) and watching the leopard rays glide past every evening. Matira Beach is one of the best beaches on the mainland, and it’s well-known for attracting various types of rays throughout the day. I even had one swim within a few feet of me while I was hanging out in the lagoon.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Hiking throughout the island is another free activity that’ll net you some incredible views and photos as you explore. Mount Paihia is one of the best in Bora Bora for reasonably athletic people, and hikers do climb it without a guide. Ask at your guesthouse for details of where the hike starts, as the entrance can be a little tricky to find.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to paid activities, you can shop around through Viator to find the best prices. One of the cheapest activities is a very well-reviewed 4WD tour of Bora Bora for just under $75 — this is a great option if you want to spend half a day seeing the very best of the island, and the reviews of the tour are glowing.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Another option is this snorkelling cruise ($81), where you can feed and play with stingrays and sharks as you explore the lagoon. This is a quintessential Bora Bora experience, and my friends who did it said it was the highlight from their trip.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If snorkelling isn’t your thing, you could take a two-hour tour of the lagoon for $88. This will take you around the water to see the most spectacular parts of Bora Bora and is worth doing if you can afford it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Food in Bora Bora;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Due to my lack of excursions, food was one of my biggest expenses in Bora Bora. Prices definitely increased from the other islands I’d visited, although (surprisingly) the quality didn’t drop.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Breakfasts! My first complaint was that after booking my accommodation dropped me an email to say that if I wanted a daily breakfast it would be $13 a day to eat there, and that if I said no and changed my mind once I was there, it would be $19 a day. I assumed that they did this because people would say no, discover there were no food options around, and then begrudgingly pay their higher price. I agreed to the breakfast and regretted it once I was there. As you can see in the photo above, that’s nowhere near $13 worth of food.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Instead, I should have walked the half-mile to Tiare Market to stock up on fresh bread, croissants, and fruit for a third of the price. There was also a small store opposite Temanuata with cheap snacks if you just wanted to grab a bag of crisps or a chocolate bar.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to lunches and dinners, there were way more affordable options than I expected. Lucky House is a pizza place beside Temanuata that drew me in with their free Wi-Fi, but kept me there with their great pizzas. I know, I know. So Polynesian. For $15, you’d get a large pizza that was actually really tasty, and would usually count for my lunch and dinner if I went down there at around 3 p.m.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Snack Matira was also within walking distance, where you could grab a burger, french fries, and a couple of drinks for around $12.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There are a few roulettes (rolling food trucks) around Matira, which is where the locals eat. There, you can find burgers, beer, fries, fish sandwiches, and chicken for around $10 a meal.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Budget travel tip: I recommend picking up a GRAYL water bottle to save money on drinks while also helping protect the environment. The water bottle works a bit like a French press — you fill it with water and then slide the filter down to the bottom of the bottle. Doing that kills 99.999% of all viruses, bacteria, and cysts in water and gets rid of any sediment, chemicals, or weird flavours or smells, making it completely safe to drink. You can drink tap water anywhere in the world with this kickass bottle and not get sick — whether you’re in India, Mozambique, or French Polynesia!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So what’s it like to travel around Bora Bora on a budget?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Was the Only Solo Traveler;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Just like the rest of my time in French Polynesia (and in the Cook Islands), I didn’t meet any other solo travelers. This wasn’t a huge surprise in Bora Bora, given that it’s best known for being a honeymoon destination, but even in the cheaper accommodations, it was all about the couples.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I did feel a little isolated on the island, but I think that had a lot to do with the guesthouse I was staying in. The other guesthouses I’d stayed at in French Polynesia had a much more communal feel, with hang out areas and group dinners arranged nightly — that wasn’t the case here. Instead, I was given my breakfast on my bungalow balcony, which was surrounded by hedges, so I couldn’t see anyone or anything. Great for privacy, but also good for making you feel lonely.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Having said that, once I ventured outside, I was approached by locals all the time and found it easy to make friends. I spent a fun evening drinking a lime-coconut-dodgy-alcoholic-concoction while hanging out with a group of Polynesian paddleboarders who invited me to join them for sunset on the beach.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But I Was Far From Being the Only Budget Traveler;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You don’t really hear much about Bora Bora as a budget destination. Or, at least, I hadn’t heard anything about it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When I was researching for this trip and reading other articles about how to visit affordably, they were mostly all about grabbing loads of credit cards, racking up your points, and then spending them on free flights and a fancy resort stay.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So I wasn’t expecting much from the budget travel scene. I was expecting it to be similar to when I visited the Maldives back in 2014 — I was the only tourist on the local ferries, I ended up being the only tourist on an entire island, I had beaches to myself, and the guesthouses were either empty or filled with locals.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Nope!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Bora Bora budget travel scene is far from undiscovered. My guesthouse was full and many of the other $50-80 a night guesthouses looked just as busy. So don’t turn up here thinking you’re some kind of intrepid explorer who’s discovered paradise on the cheap. A lot of people already have.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But the island’s big, so while there are a lot of people on it, it never, ever felt crowded.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Is It Worth It?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It’s funny: before I arrived in Bora Bora, I was expecting to hate it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d just had an incredible trip around some of the lesser-visited Society Islands and was sure Bora Bora wouldn’t compare. I mean, Maupiti, for example, is geographically very similar to Bora Bora — it has an extinct volcano in the centre, one main road that winds around the island, pretty beaches, a large lagoon, and some beautiful islands on the outer edges of the lagoon. Wouldn’t Bora Bora just be similar, but crammed full of rich tourists, overrun with resorts, and ridiculously expensive?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To my great surprise, it was none of those things, and I was seriously impressed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bora Bora’s a special place, and I didn’t realise how special until I saw it for myself. I mean, it’s seriously gorgeous — like blow-your-mind-spectacularly-gorgeous to the point where you constantly feel like you’re living in a Photoshopped world. There really aren’t that many people on the island either — you can probably see from all of my photos above that there’s never any crowds anywhere. I don’t know if they’re all on excursions or hidden away in resorts (probably), but I never felt like I was in an overly-touristy place.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And the prices? They’re not that bad.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ll pay a little more for food. You’ll pay a little more for transportation. You’ll pay a little more for the excursions. But it’s not eye-wateringly bad. It’s $20 for dinner instead of $15; it’s $15 a day for a bicycle rental instead of $5. It’s $70 for a lagoon cruise instead of $50.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So yes, I’d say that Bora Bora is definitely worth visiting. I’d also say that it would be a good idea to visit another island or two in the Society Islands while you’re there to see a different side to French Polynesia that isn’t just about tourism and excursions — Huahine was my favourite island and was very different to Bora Bora.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
"So yeah. Bam! Bora Bora on a budget. It’s totally possible.""";;;;;;;;;
"1623408060-420,""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/blog/page/17"",""I Was Abandoned at the Burmese Border"",""https://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/abandoned-at-the-burmese-border/"",""I Was Abandoned at the Burmese Border"",""August 15, 2020"",""It was Songkran in Thailand and I was going to be celebrating it in a minivan.";;;;;;;;;
My Thai visa was about to expire and the easiest way to extend it was via visa run to Myanmar and back. There’s dozens of companies in Chiang Mai offering this service, picking you up from your guesthouse, driving you to the border to get stamped out and back in, and then dropping you off before nightfall.;;;;;;;;;
I was waiting in the lobby at 7 a.m., far too early for most backpackers to be awake but today, for Songkran, they were out in full force.;;;;;;;;;
When the minivan pulled up beside the lobby, I made a run for it, shielding my face with my hands and bellowing, “No water! No water!” at the chuckling twenty-somethings who were gripping buckets of ice cold water.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t believe a temporary ceasefire was held until I was safely inside.;;;;;;;;;
As always, I took a seat at the front of the van to try and minimise my chances of motion sickness. Driving around the moat offered a different perspective to Thailand’s biggest water fight and yet, somehow felt more dangerous. I’d read that Songkran is the cause of the highest number of road-related deaths in Thailand and it wasn’t hard to see why. Slippery roads, intoxicated drivers, and nobody being able to see where they were going didn’t make for high safety levels.;;;;;;;;;
If I’d have thought about it a little harder, I wouldn’t have chosen today to do my visa run.;;;;;;;;;
I waved to fellow travellers as they joined me in my van, all in various degrees of drenched. There were the jaded old expats who’d spent far too long in Thailand and couldn’t stop complaining, the long-term traveller who put my ten months of travel to shame with his five years on the road, the English teacher who’d been living there for three years, and a dozen or so travellers who wanted longer to explore. Once everyone was inside, our driver turned up the volume of the awful Thai love songs, signalling for everyone to fumble for their earphones and drift off to sleep. I was too transfixed by the views to allow myself to drift off.;;;;;;;;;
I’d expected the water-based chaos to calm down once we escaped Chiang Mai, but the madness continued all the way up to the Burmese border. I was astounded to see that Songkran really did encompass the entire country. As we drove through big cities and tiny villages that few tourists would ever have reason to visit, I spotted tens of thousands of people joining in with the celebrations.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Songkran from the moat;;;;;;;;;
Four hours later, we arrived at the border.;;;;;;;;;
“One hour,” the driver announced to us as we piled out of the van.;;;;;;;;;
I stepped down on to the dusty road and scanned my surroundings. The street was lined with fifty silver minivans, all identical to ours; all here for the same purpose. Visa runs were big business in Thailand and hundreds of companies offered trips to the nearest border and back every day. I watched as dozens of backpackers marched past a row of Thai flags and towards a blue building in the shape of an arch.;;;;;;;;
I stood for a moment, trying to figure out how this process worked. As I caught a glimpse of Myanmar beyond the fast-flowing Mekong River, I was hit by the realisation that I’d been in Thailand for too long. I’d been travelling for ten months and spent six of them in this country. It wasn’t that I resented it – living in Chiang Mai had allowed me to build a travel blogging income that could enable me to travel indefinitely – but there were so many other places I wanted to see.;;;;;;;;;
Like Myanmar.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I joined the queue for immigration, smiling at the blonde girl who’d hurried up a few seconds after me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Do you know how this process works?” she asked in a New York accent. I watched as she brushed her wavy hair out of her face with a perfectly manicured hand.;;;;;;;;;
“Not really,” I said. “But I can’t imagine it’s complicated. Just hand over your passport when you’re asked for it, hop into Myanmar and then back into Thailand.”;;;;;;;;;
She didn’t look convinced.;;;;;;;;;
“It’ll be fine,” I said. “These things always are.”;;;;;;;;;
My words, apparently, were not reassuring because she now looked even more terrified.;;;;;;;;;
“Oh, hey, good luck,” she whispered, pointing ahead of me. I looked around and saw I’d reached the front of the queue. A jolly immigration officer was beckoning me.;;;;;;;;;
He greeted me with a wide smile and I eyed him with wariness. This was the friendliest guy I’d ever seen working at immigration. It had to be a trick of some sort, designed to lure me into confessing to a crime I hadn’t committed. I captured my tongue between my teeth and said nothing. He flicked through the pages of my passport for a few moments, held it up to my face, then stamped me through without incident. Phew. One down, four to go.;;;;;;;;;
Getting stamped into Myanmar was just as simple and just like that, I was in a country I’d always dreamed of visiting. I estimated I had around half an hour before I had to be back at the minivan and I wanted to soak up as much of the country for as long as I could.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent some time turning semi circles in the dirt, rubbing my flip-flops against the ground for no other reason than because I wanted to take a small part of Myanmar back with me.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Not that I had anywhere to keep chunks of Burmese earth in our apartment.;;;;;;;;;
With a sad smile, I twirled around one final time and re-entered Thailand with a promise to return some day soon.;;;;;;;;;
Back on the Thai side, I wandered past a row of shops selling colourful trinkets for tourists with more money than sense. I didn’t need a Burmese flag, a handful of coins, an emerald, or a samurai sword, but I considered throwing out my one pair of pants to make room for them anyway. Living out of a backpack could be frustrating at times. If I wanted to carry around a paperweight of the Shwedagon Pagoda, I’d have to throw out a pagoda-sized pile of clothes in order to do so.;;;;;;;;;
I lingered for a while, meandering my way back towards our minivan. I’d had a rollercoaster of a week, thanks to getting caught up in a tsunami scare a few days earlier, but one thing was certain: I didn’t want to stop travelling. I knew it was strange that a border crossing and spending five minutes in a new country could give me so much joy but after that terrifying evacuation, my emotions were all over the place.;;;;;;;;;
Market on the tracks, as viewed from Yangon’s Circle Train;;;;;;;;;
I found my minivan and yanked back the door. My mind was overflowing with ideas for where I could go next. Dave would be heading to Australia in a few days to see his family and I had a month to go anywhere in the world. I slid onto the front seat. Maybe Laos could be a good option? My arm brushed against something warm and hairy, and I discovered I was trying to squeeze onto the same seat as an old man.;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Whoops, sorry,” I mumbled, standing up to find another seat further back. Staring back at me were a dozen puzzled faces I had never seen before.;;;;;;;;;
“Oh no!” I cried out, my face flushing red. I stood in silence as if waiting for them to tell me I could leave. Someone coughed. “I guess I’ll just…um… go?” I asked them, before crawling back outside.;;;;;;;;;
“That was embarrassing,” I mumbled to myself.;;;;;;;;;
I looped back to the border and worked my way back down past the minivans. Not mine… not mine… not mine… not mine… And then back up the other side of the road. Not mine… not mine… not mine… not mine… And I was back the border again.;;;;;;;;;
Had they left without me? ;;;;;;;;;
The thought hit me like a bucket of iced water to the face.;;;;;;;;;
I sat down on the kerb and rested my head in my hands. I had to come up with a plan. Something sensible. What would Dave do?;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t have a phone to call for help.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t have a watch to tell me what the time was, but I was certain my allocated hour was now up.;;;;;;;;;
I didn’t have any money beyond what I’d needed to get into Myanmar.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I racked my brain, I remembered my conversation with Dave from that morning.;;;;;;;;;
“Remember to talk to people in the van,” he’d told me. “That’s what I always do, because I want to make sure I’m remembered. Then there’s no chance of the van driving off without me.”;;;;;;;;;
I’d planned on it but the second I’d climbed inside, my shyness had got the better of me and I’d kept my lips firmly sealed. I hadn’t said a word.;;;;;;;;;
View of Kalaw at sunset;;;;;;;;;
“Hey!”;;;;;;;;;
I felt a sharp tapping on my shoulder and turned to see the girl from the queue standing behind me.;;;;;;;;;
“Hi!” I said, standing up to face her. “How’s it going?”;;;;;;;;;
“Yeah, pretty good. What are you up to?”;;;;;;;;;
“Not much. I think my minivan drove off and abandoned me. So, uh, there’s that.”;;;;;;;;;
“Oh, shit, no way,” she gasped, reaching for my arm to steady herself. She stared at me with misty eyes; as if I’d told her I’d been caught smuggling drugs across the border and was scheduled for a beheading at sunset. “What are you going to do?”;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“I’ll figure something out,” I said with a breeziness I didn’t feel. “It’s no big deal.”;;;;;;;;;
“Rebecca!” A tall muscular guy grabbed her arm and began to pull her backwards. “We’ve got to leave now.”;;;;;;;;;
“Okay, well, good luck!” she called, as she was whisked into the safety of a minivan full of people who hadn’t forgotten about her.;;;;;;;;;
I watched her leave, shaking my head in frustration. Two days earlier, when I had been convinced a tsunami was about to take my life, I’d told myself that if I happened to make it out of there alive, I’d never be afraid again. The tsunami had put my life and misadventures into perspective and given me a sense of fearlessness I’d never felt before.;;;;;;;;;
Why couldn’t I recapture that now?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Excuse me?”;;;;;;;;;
I looked over in the direction of the voice. A tall, skinny girl with short black hair was looking down at me through a pair of fluorescent pink sunglasses.;;;;;;;;;
“Yep?”;;;;;;;;;
“Were you on my minivan?” she asked in a New Zealand accent. It reminded me of Dave.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“I’m not sure.”;;;;;;;;;
“I thought I recognised you. I’ve just discovered my van has driven off without me but if you were on my van then that means it’s probably still here.”;;;;;;;;;
“Ah,” I said, and made a mental note to memorise the features of my fellow passengers in the future. “I think I was maybe on your minivan because mine is missing too.”;;;;;;;;;
Her hands flew to her mouth. “Oh, thank goodness I found you. Do you think he’s left without us? He told us to meet him in an hour but it’s been ninety minutes.”;;;;;;;;;
Ninety minutes? Whoops. I’d definitely mistimed my border crossing.;;;;;;;;;
I shrugged. “Have you seen anyone else from the van?”;;;;;;;;;
“No. You?”;;;;;;;;;
I shook my head.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
As I watched her run her fingers through her hair in distress, I was hit by a sudden burst of confidence. Leaving her stood in the middle of the pavement, I strode up to the nearest minivan driver. He had a half-smoked cigarette dangling between yellowed teeth.;;;;;;;;;
“Hello,” I said.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Hello.”;;;;;;;;;
“Our minivan left without us and we need to get back to Chiang Mai. Can you help? Do you have any room in your van for us?”;;;;;;;;;
He nodded then wandered into a convenience store.;;;;;;;;;
I turned to the girl and frowned. That was it? That was all I needed to do? That was… easy. ;;;;;;;;;
“Sorted, I guess,” I said with a shrug, trying to fake confidence. Who would have ever thought I’d be the person to take control of a situation?;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A sharp whistle pierced the air.;;;;;;;;;
“Our minivan,” the girl cried out and we exchanged confused looks.;;;;;;;;;
“How do you know?” I asked, squinting at the silver vehicle that looked like every single other one on this street.;;;;;;;;;
“The driver. Don’t you recognise him?”;;;;;;;;;
I looked over at him. He was hanging out the window and waving his arms in our direction. The door slid open and a couple of familiar-ish faces sat laughing at us. With a spring in my step, I followed the girl across the road and scrambled inside.;;;;;;;;;
“What happened?” I asked the vanful of meek faces.;;;;;;;;;
"“Never mind that,” muttered a cranky-sounding expat. “Can we please just get back to Chiang Mai?”""";;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A fifty-minute flight from Tahiti brought me there, to paradise. It was my first taste of French Polynesia outside of the bustling capital and I couldn’t have chosen a more different island to visit next.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maupiti is small, home to just over 1,000 locals, and there are only a handful of places to stay at — none of which are fancy resorts or hotels. Agoda lists only one guesthouse, and it’s kind of pricey, Airbnb has a handful of bungalows and private rooms and Booking.com/HostelBookers/HostelWorld have nothing to show.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Finding accommodation in Maupiti therefore involved scanning TripAdvisor reviews in the hope that someone would mention the booking details of guesthouses, then sending off emails in the hope they’d be answered. Some of the guesthouses had websites you could contact the owners through, but they were all very Geocities-esque and often entirely in French. Guesthouse owners rarely speak any English here, so booking my stay required a lot of Google Translating.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
When you touchdown in Maupiti, though? It’s so worth the extra hassle.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
To the locals, Maupiti is nicknamed Little Bora Bora, because it’s said to be just how Bora Bora was fifty-or-so years ago, before all of the tourists and overwater bungalows and cruise ships arrived. Having now been to both islands, I can see where the comparison comes from. They’re both mountainous islands, with an extinct volcano at the centre of the main island. They’re both surrounded by a shimmering lagoon, and on the outskirts of that lagoon are dozens of smaller islands.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
That’s where the similarities end.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Maupiti, I met one other couple who could speak English — the rest of the guests, the locals, and the guesthouse owners spoke only French. I loved that whenever one of the owners needed to ask me a question or tell me something, they’d grab one of the English- and French-speaking guests and bring them to my door to translate! On Bora Bora, while French was still the dominant language, there was a lot more English spoken in guesthouses and restaurants.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maupiti is quiet. This is a place to come to get away from your stresses and relax on the beach. It’s a place where you rarely hear even the engines of a car or motorbike; where the only sounds are the locals calling out bonjour to everyone they pass on their bicycles. On Bora Bora, things were much more chaotic: trucks whizzing by on the roads, jet skis and boat trips arriving at and leaving from the beach all the time, loud music, sounds of construction ringing out.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maupiti is uncrowded. Most of the guesthouses on the island only have around three or four rooms, so things are kept small and quiet. I was staying close to the prettiest beach on the island, and had it to myself for much of the day. When I walked the circumference of the island one day, I ran into roughly ten locals during my entire ten-kilometre walk. On the afternoon when I hiked up the volcano in the centre of the island, I met only one other couple doing the walk. On Bora Bora, you can’t walk more than a couple of metres without passing by someone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Bora Bora, guesthouses and hotels and resorts and tour companies and restaurants are everywhere. I don’t think I saw more than one restaurant on Maupiti and there’s just one tour company on the island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and Maupiti doesn’t even have an ATM!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Like practically every single one of my arrivals in a new place, immediately after landing in Maupiti, I stumbled headfirst into disaster.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
We arrived at Maupiti’s airport (an open-air building with one counter and a couple of wooden benches), and after grabbing my luggage from one of the benches, I began my search for my guesthouse owners.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I wandered around in circles, scanning every sign with hope, watching as tourists were greeted with flower leis and welcomed with hugs. The crowd began to disperse, and I watched as the other people from my flight were led to a series of small boats that would take them across the lagoon and to their accommodation. I felt like bursting into tears when I realised I was stranded on this small patch of land in the middle of the lagoon that served as a runway.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A teenager approached me and said something to me in French.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“English?” I asked hopefully.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
He frowned. “Okay?”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I shook my head. “My fare owner — not here.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
He asked for the name of my guesthouse, then looked around as I had done, frowning when he realised that nobody was left waiting for me. “Air Tahiti ferry,” he suddenly announced, leading me towards a small boat. “Guesthouse. There.” He pointed at the main island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I thanked him, crossed my fingers, and clambered aboard.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you’ve read this site for any amount of time, you’ll know that my guesthouse owners were not, in fact, waiting for me over at the jetty. More on that ridiculous incident in my next post.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Several hours later, I arrived at Pension Espace and was finally able to unwind.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
For roughly thirty-six hours before my next flight.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Yep, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from my trip to French Polynesia (and, in fact, the past five years of travel, although I don’t seem to ever be able to pay attention to it), it’s that you’ll be far happier if you visit fewer places and don’t move around every two or three days.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
On Maupiti, where everything’s chilled and everyone goes slow, it was a travel crime to arrive, spend one full day rushing around in order to see everything, and then leave the following day.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Views of Maupiti’s lagoon and the main part of town;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Maupiti was an unusual place to stay as an independent traveller, because you’re kind of forced into a resort-type situation. There’s one main restaurant on the island (an hour-long walk from my guesthouse), so your guesthouse will provide you with breakfast and dinner. At Pension Espace, if I wanted to take a tour of the lagoon to snorkel with manta rays, it was the guesthouse staff who took you out on their own boat. If you wanted to rent a car, you’d borrow the owners’ for the day. It was like being welcomed into a family and I loved it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Speaking of feeling welcomed, Maupiti is probably the one place in the world where every single local on the island goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed. On my first morning on the island, literally every single person I passed would call out bonjour if they were on a bicycle or come over to talk to me if they were on foot. Everyone wanted to know my name, where I was from, and why I was on Maupiti. One of the guys at my guesthouse ran into some fellow Christians on the island and on Sunday, they picked him up from our guesthouse, took him to their church, and dropped him off again.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
So, on the first morning, I passed the wonderful locals, relishing in the opportunity to learn how to say bonjour so that I sounded reasonably French rather than literally pronouncing it bon-jaw like the uncultured idiot that I am.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’d had two options for how to spend my day: snorkelling with manta rays in the lagoon and checking out Maupiti’s coral garden, or hiking to the top of Mt. Teurafaatiu, the volcanic mountain that marks the highest point of the island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I opted for the latter, still scarred from exposing myself to my tour group in Aitutaki, though I suspected I’d likely end up regretting not taking advantage of the chance to see manta rays.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It quickly became apparent that this was going to be the toughest hike of my life. The trail wasn’t well-marked and often left me wandering around in circles, tripping over volcanic rock, and worrying that I was just trampling through someone’s garden.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I continued on, guessing which way to go next, because there have been far too many times when I’ve turned back around in fear only to realise later on that I had been right all along.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I entered a clearing and heard the sound of footsteps coming towards me. I waited.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Hello!” a man called out in a German accent.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Hello!” I called back.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Are you doing the hike?” he asked, scampering down some sharp boulders to join me. His friend jumped after him.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Yep. Is it hard?”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Yes, a little bit. Do you have enough water?”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I held up my small water bottle. “Yeah.”;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
“Hahaha.” He turned to his friend and they both cracked up. “That’s a good joke,” he said;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I watched them disappear down the track and turned my attention to the rocks ahead of me. I had a volcano to climb.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And so I climbed.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I fell.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I stumbled.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I tripped and smacked my expensive camera into a rock.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But I climbed nonetheless, because the views were getting more and more spectacular.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
But the clouds were getting darker and darker.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And my photos were getting crappier and crappier.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I was an hour into the hike when the clouds unleashed a torrent of rain upon me. I sought shelter beneath a tree, watching in dismay as my trail turned to mud; as my fingers turned red with the cold.;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I waited for it to stop, then headed back down to the main road, disappointed, but glad that it hadn’t happened while I was at the top.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And sure, I missed that spectacular view, but that just gives me a reason to return someday.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

And while I’m showing you photos of Maupiti that other people took, let me also show you what the island looks like when the sun’s out. What a difference a blue sky and some sunshine can make!;;;;;;;;;

But it wasn’t sunny while I was there, and that’s okay. That just gives me another reason to head back some other time.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And I adored the Maupiti I got to see regardless. I loved the laidback way of life. I loved the incredibly friendly locals. I loved the ridiculous scenery that had me feeling like I was in Jurassic Park. I loved the delicious fresh fruits and fish I ate for every meal. I loved learning how to crack open a coconut for the first time, thanks to the kickass staff at my guesthouse.;;;;;;;;;

Maupiti was one of my favourite islands I visited in French Polynesia, even with the crappy weather. If you want a glimpse of how Bora Bora used to be, head there. It’s a wonderful place to visit.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

Oh, and if you do go? Be sure to spend way more time there than I did. It’s worth it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What to Know Before Visiting Maupiti;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Where to stay: I stayed at Pension Espace, but had originally booked at Pension Tereia. Pension Tereia had some of the best reviews for the best price on the island, but given that their incompetence left me stranded and terrified on Maupiti for several hours, I can’t recommend staying there. Also, because I have no idea what it was actually like. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

Pension Espace was lovely but pricey at $100 a night (Note: I paid $70 a night because I ended up paying what I would have at Tereia). The $100 includes breakfast and dinner, and the breakfasts were large enough that I didn’t need to eat lunch. The rooms were actually nice (a lot of the rooms on Maupiti looked super-basic), but without A/C or an efficient fan, it got ridiculously hot at night — that was my only complaint. The owners were lovely, the food was seriously delicious, and I loved the communal atmosphere, where everyone ate together each morning and evening. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What to do: If you want to hike Mt. Teurafaatiu, the highest point of the island, prepare for a tough trek! To get to the start of the hike, walk into town and turn inland when you reach “Snack Tarona”, the main (only?) restaurant on the island. From there, follow the white and yellow stripes. Wear hiking boots, bring plenty of water and sunscreen, and prepare for some vertical climbs with ropes. There are reports of people breaking their legs during the climb. Yeah, I’m kind of glad I had to turn around when I did.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
If you want to take a lagoon cruise and snorkel with manta rays, your guesthouse will likely offer this service. If not, there’s one tour company on the island you can do it through: Sammy Maupiti Tours.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
How to get there: If you’re not sailing around French Polynesia, the only way to get there is via an Air Tahiti flight. They run four times a week from Tahiti and the other Society Islands.;;;;;;;;;

In October, I published 27.;;;;;;;;;
Yikes.;;;;;;;;;
When I set myself the goal of publishing a blog post every day for a month, I had no idea how it was going to go. In the past, I’ve announced multiple times that I was going to start posting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and rarely managed it for more than a week.;;;;;;;;;
What was I doing thinking I could publish every day?;;;;;;;;;
Especially during a month where I’d be travelling for most of it. Especially as I didn’t have any drafts to work on. Especially as I’ve never been a prolific blogger.;;;;;;;;;
I even managed to post after spending a full day exploring Vianden, in Luxembourg!;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
And here’s what I learned.;;;;;;;;;
I Did This to Combat Perfectionism;;;;;;;;;
I used to take pride in being a perfectionist.;;;;;;;;;
I thought it was an admirable quality to have. That it meant everything I produced would be perfect. That I wouldn’t ever publish anything I wasn’t happy with. That I would be more successful the longer and harder I worked on something.;;;;;;;;;
While I was in Berlin, I reread Brene Brown’s the Gifts of Imperfection — the book that’s had the greatest impact on my life to date — and this passage on perfectionism jumped up and smacked me right in the face:;;;;;;;;;
“Perfectionism is a self-destructive and addictive belief system that fuels this primary thought: “If I look perfect, live perfectly, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid or minimize the painful feelings of shame, judgment, and blame.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Perfectionism is defeating and self-destructive simply because there is no such thing as perfect. Perfection is an unattainable goal. Additionally, perfectionism is more about perception – we want to be perceived as perfect. Again, this is unattainable – there is no way to control perception, regardless of how much time and energy we spend trying.;;;;;;;;;
Perfectionism is addictive because when we invariably do experience shame, judgment, and blame, we often believe it’s because we weren’t perfect enough so rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism, we become even more entrenched in our quest to live, look, and do everything just right.”;;;;;;;;;
Oh my god, I thought. She was describing me.;;;;;;;;;
I published so little this year (and every year) because I’m obsessed with only sharing what I deem to be perfect.;;;;;;;;;
I toil over blog posts. I spend weeks editing them. And honestly? I spend a huge amount of that time procrastinating on Twitter. When I’m aiming for perfection, I usually end up coming to the conclusion that it’s unattainable, which leads to me doing whatever I can to avoid facing it.;;;;;;;;;
This isn’t a new development. I started Never Ending Footsteps six years ago and I’ve posted 350 times since then. That’s an average of one post every two weeks. I’ve always been an irregular blogger, but it’s something I’ve dreamed of changing.;;;;;;;;;
First on my list was tackling my perfectionism.;;;;;;;;;
In order to do this, I set myself a challenge to post every single day in October.;;;;;;;;;
And It Worked;;;;;;;;;
I had so much fun writing my blog posts in October!;;;;;;;;;
Without my crushing goal to make everything as perfect as it could be, I could instead focus my attention on enjoying the writing process. I no longer had to agonise over every word choice. Posting whenever I knew something was good/great rather than perfect took an enormous amount of pressure off.;;;;;;;;;
I started enjoying hitting the publish button rather than cowering from it.;;;;;;;;;
It Boosted My Creativity, Too;;;;;;;;;
I enjoyed getting to cover a wider range of topics than I usually do.;;;;;;;;;
Because here’s the thing: when I was only publishing once every 14 days, I believed every single post had to be about my travels. As a result of my slow posting schedule, I now have roughly two years’ worth of adventures to catch you up on. I could never justify writing resources about how I find cheap flights or how I back up my photos — things I’m asked all the time through email — because I didn’t feel as though I could use one of my two topics a month on something that wasn’t furthering my story.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
In October, I felt as though I could spend time creating helpful posts in addition to travel narratives. Without so much pressure to catch up on what I’d been up to over the past few years, I found time to experiment more and try different styles of writing.;;;;;;;;;
I felt a fresh burst of enthusiasm for Never Ending Footsteps when I decided to start writing about Belize and Guatemala, just because I’d always wished I’d had a chance to share what my experiences in these countries were like.;;;;;;;;;
I Learned I’ll Always Go Long;;;;;;;;;
I thought I’d end up writing a whole lot of short and sweet blog posts in October, but the exact opposite happened. Only a couple of them were less than 1,000 words. My longest post was over 3,000, and most of them were in the 2,000-2,500 range.;;;;;;;;;
Long-form writing is my jam.;;;;;;;;;
The short 500-word posts I used to publish back in 2011 aren’t something I can see myself returning to in the future. A big part of this is due to the evolution of my reading habits in recent years — I actively seek out longer, more detailed pieces when I’m hanging out online, and that’s greatly influenced my own writing.;;;;;;;;;
It Wasn’t as Hard as I Thought;;;;;;;;;
I expected to find writing so frequently to be tough, but it wasn’t. It turns out when I set myself a deadline rather than giving myself a vague amount of time to write a post, I can actually get stuff done.;;;;;;;;;
I found that it took roughly four or five hours for me to write and edit a blog post, which meant that even while I was travelling, I was able to find the time to sit down and bash out a few thousand words.;;;;;;;;;
Interestingly to me, the four days where I missed publishing a post were all while I was at home in Lisbon. I found that when I had 16 hours to sit down and write a post, I was far less likely to finish it than if I had three hours in-between sightseeing. Deadlines are also, apparently, my jam.;;;;;;;;;
How Did it Benefit My Site?;;;;;;;;;
In the back of my mind, I hoped I’d see a benefit businesswise, but if I’m being honest, I saw more negatives than positives.;;;;;;;;;
With the exception of a couple of posts that did great (my post on finding a base and why I’ve stopped using Airbnb), traffic to Never Ending Footsteps remained much the same. The vast majority of visitors to my site come from places like Google and Pinterest, from which traffic numbers remains steady every day, regardless of how much I post. While I experienced a boost to my traffic, relative to my overall numbers, it was small.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And that growth definitely dropped off towards the end of the month, when I think you guys were suffering from Lauren overload.;;;;;;;;;
Additionally, I had more email unsubscribes than subscribes for the first time in the site’s history. Unsurprisingly, it turns out when you email somebody every single day, they tend to get annoyed with you. I should have done this differently and sent out a weekly email sharing all of my posts from the past seven days, rather than one for every single post. I’ll know for next time.;;;;;;;;;
My Facebook engagement took a huge tumble this month, too. Sharing a new blog post every single day massively decreased my reach and therefore the amount of people who were clicking through to read. Even when I paid $10 to boost a post, I only ended up with around quarter of the likes as I used to get a few months ago.;;;;;;;;;
Finally, the number of comments on my blog posts also dropped. I pride myself on having a large, helpful, fun community on my site, and when I published so frequently, comments dropped off massively. Nobody was having conversations. Rather than getting 50 or so comments on a new post, I struggled to gain anything more than single figures.;;;;;;;;;
Towards the end of the challenge, I was so conscious of my falling stats that I even stopped sending all of posts out by email or sharing them on social media because I was concerned I was annoying everyone.;;;;;;;;;
An Experiment That Worked, But That I Won’t Continue;;;;;;;;;
I’m pleased I decided to take on the challenge, because it did exactly what I needed it to do. I’m no longer crippled with hesitation whenever I hit the publish button, because I know I don’t need days and weeks to edit an article to perfection.;;;;;;;;;
Because there’s no such thing as perfection.;;;;;;;;;
As I mentioned above, though, I didn’t see many benefits to convince me this is a Good Thing for the site. I felt as though I was annoying my readers, that people were reading fewer of my posts, and that I couldn’t dive deeply into a subject with such little time.;;;;;;;;;
Going forwards, I’m hoping I’ll finally be able to hit my twice or thrice a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, most likely) posting target that I’ve probably announced a dozen times in this site’s history but failed to stick to for more than about three days. Behind the scenes, I’ll most likely continue writing blog posts regularly and saving the extras in surplus in order to remain consistent while I’m travelling or (please god no) if I find my anxiety has returned.;;;;;;;;;

My first time in Greece. My first time on water without experiencing motion sickness. My first time properly learning how to sail. My first time travelling carry-on only.;;;;;;;;;
Yes, if you’re going sailing, whether it’s for Yacht Week or chartering a yacht with friends as I did, the key is to pack light. Life on the water is incredibly simple and you’ll spend the vast majority of it in swimwear.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What was it like traveling with just a carry-on bag for the first time? Surprisingly freeing! The biggest upsides were not having to worry about lost luggage, not having to wait for my bags at the baggage reclaim, not having to pay to check my backpack, and not experiencing back pain from walking around with a heavy pack on.;;;;;;;;;
The biggest downside? My backpack wouldn’t fit under the seat in front of me on the plane so I had to put it in the overhead lockers. Embarrassingly, I don’t possess enough upper-body strength to lift my bag up that high. Hahaha. So I had to ask someone to put it up there for me every time I get on a plane. So mortifying.;;;;;;;;;
Anyway, I’m excited to share this detailed packing list with you. I know you guys have been asking for more information on what I take with me on my trips, so consider this the first of many country/region-specific guides!;;;;;;;;;
Which Backpack to Bring?;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to sailing, you really don’t need to bring a huge amount of stuff with you. You’ll spend the vast majority of your days in the water and will quickly stop caring about what you look like. With so few essentials on a trip like this, you can easily travel with a carry-on backpack.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I recommend a backpack over a suitcase or holdall, simply because getting on and off the boat via a wobbly, slanted wooden plank is tricky enough as it is. You don’t want to try to do that while wheeling a suitcase along after you!;;;;;;;;;
I opted to bring the Osprey Farpoint 40l backpack (a brand new purchase!) with me. I’m already a huge fan and plan on making this my main backpack for all of my future trips! It’s super-comfortable, easy to pack, and has plenty of compartments to help you keep your belongings organised. You can read about why I always travel with Osprey backpacks here.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Clothing;;;;;;;;;
When it comes to living the yacht life, you’ll want to bring a load of swimwear with you. But you won’t spend the entire time in it. You’ll also want clothes for mornings and evenings when the temperature drops, and if you get sunburnt, you’ll definitely want something to cover up with. Remember that you won’t be able to do laundry on the yacht, so bring enough outfits for the amount of days you’ll be spending at sea.;;;;;;;;;
Note: I always, always overpack when it comes to tops. I’m so tiny that most of my strap tops will ball up to the size of a sock, so I take advantage of this and bring quite a few options!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Five bikinis;;;;;;;;;
Two strap tops;;;;;;;;;
Three vest tops;;;;;;;;;
Seven t-shirts;;;;;;;;;
Two pairs of denim shorts ;;;;;;;;;
One dress — I still travel with the one I had made in Hoi An back in 2013! I can’t believe it’s still going strong, as I think Dave paid about $20 for it!;;;;;;;;;
Enough underwear for the length of my trip;;;;;;;;;
One outfit to keep you warm: Take a look at the projected weather forecast for the evenings, then make the decision as to whether this is necessary. For me, anything below 20 degrees Celsius has me shivering, so those 15 degree evenings put me in jeans and a fleece for the night.;;;;;;;;;
Flip-flops: You don’t really need anything other than flip-flops for a sailing trip — I travelled with these tropical-themed Havianas — and even then, I only wore them when heading out for dinner in the evening. If you’re planning on doing any hiking while you’re there, you may want to bring some Teva sandals with you — I’ve travelled with, and really like, these ones.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Quick-dry travel towel: These get a lot of hate from travelers, but I absolutely adore mine! Although we were given towels to use for showers on the boat, I still had to bring one for beach use and general sunbathing. My Sea to Summit DryLite Towel in extra large was perfect for this and didn’t take up much space in my backpack.;;;;;;;;;
Medications;;;;;;;;;
Pretty self-explanatory here! I didn’t bring much with me, just a very basic first aid kit. You’ll be able to stock up on anything you forget at pharmacies in the villages you moor at.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dramamine;;;;;;;;;
Painkillers;;;;;;;;;
Imodium;;;;;;;;;
Anti-histamines;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
Technology;;;;;;;;;
I always bring a shit-ton of technology with me on my trips, so you may not want to bring as much as I did. One essential, though, is a camera. You’ll be wanting to snap as many photos as possible while you’re in such a spectacular part of the world. Here’s all the tech I brought with me:;;;;;;;;;

Sony A7ii with 28-70mm lens: My main DSLR these days is the Sony A7ii with a 28-70mm lens, along with a couple of 32 GB SanDisk SD cards. At $2,000 for the full set-up, this is pricey AF, and I bought it as an investment in this site. I’m incredibly happy with the quality of the camera and lens, though, and would highly recommend it if you have the cash and are looking to invest in a mirrorless system. If you’re not into photography, just bring whatever camera you usually use on holiday.;;;;;;;;;
GoPro HERO3+ with accessories: GoPros are fantastic for sailing trips, because they’re small, lightweight, and come with an underwater casing. I used mine with the GoPro 3-Way Grip, because it’s great for taking selfies, but in the future, I’d consider getting a floating selfie stick to use. I was way too nervous about accidentally letting go and watching my GoPro sink to the bottom of the sea.;;;;;;;;;
iPhone SE with a local SIM card: Wi-fi was pretty rare, even when we were moored in a village, so I’m glad I picked up a local SIM card before getting on the yacht. Too Many Adapters has a detailed guide for buying SIM cards in Greece — we paid 10 euros for 5 GB of data, which is amazing value for money for Europe. Having that much data allowed me to Snapchat and Instagram my way around the Ionian, and check my emails in case I was missing anything important. I also used my phone as my camera while we were actually sailing.;;;;;;;;;
Kindle Paperwhite: I read a lot of books on this trip, making my Kindle my very best friend. I read whenever I was sunbathing on the yacht in the middle of the day, or in the evenings while everyone was showering before dinner. And you know what you should read on your sailing trip? An incredible memoir titled How Not to Travel the World. It’ll be the highlight of your trip!;;;;;;;;;

        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Various chargers/adapters: Make sure you bring a European travel adapter with you!;;;;;;;;;
What not to bring: I also brought my Macbook Pro and my Nexus 7 tablet with me. I didn’t touch either, so would leave them both at home next time. I also brought a portable battery box for charging, but we had USB power on the boat at all times, so I didn’t need to use it.;;;;;;;;;
Toiletries;;;;;;;;;
Because I was going to be travelling carry-on only for my trip to Greece, I had to be cautious with how many toiletries I brought with me and what size they were. I recommend just heading to the supermarket or drug store and picking up travel-sized products of anything liquid you want to bring with you. Here’s what I took on board with me:;;;;;;;;;
Toothbrush and toothpaste: Self-explanatory. I picked up a sample-sized tube of toothpaste beforehand and brought my normal toothbrush with me.;;;;;;;;;
A razor: Again, self-explanatory!;;;;;;;;;
Deodorant: You’ll definitely want some of this, as you’ll be hot and sweaty for much of your time on the ocean. Again, I grabbed a small roll-on deodorant from a drug store in advance.;;;;;;;;;
Sunscreen: It seemed pointless buying a teeny tiny sized bottle of sunscreen as I knew I’d probably get through all of that in a day. I recommend just picking up a big bottle once you arrive in Greece, so that you’ll have enough for your stay.;;;;;;;;;
Solid shampoo and conditioner: I love LUSH’s solid shampoo and conditioner bars — they leave my hair feeling soft and shiny, are super-lightweight and small, and last me over three months when using them continuously! Because they’re so small, I’d definitely recommend picking up some conditioner, too — that salt water can really mess up your hair.;;;;;;;;;
A small bar of soap: Just a random bar of soap I took from the bathroom of a fancy hotel I stayed at once.;;;;;;;;;
Tangle Teezer: I’ve been traveling with a Tangle Teezer since I first started traveling, and it was a lifesaver on the yacht! It’s the only hairbrush I’ve found that can get rid of all of all of the knots in my crazy, curly hair.;;;;;;;;;
A toiletry bag: I use one of these small bags I got from Sephora.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Beauty Products;;;;;;;;;
I save all of my samples I get from Sephora for short trips like these, so grabbing a few items to take with me was super-simple.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
While I quickly learned that I wasn’t going to be wearing a full face on the yacht, having a teeny tiny sample sizes meant that I didn’t really care if I’d brought anything unnecessary. Here’s what I brought:;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Too Faced’s Hangover Face Primer and Shadow Insurance Eye Primer — both travel-sized;;;;;;;;;

If I could redo my makeup packing, I’d leave my foundation, primers, bronzer, and highlighter behind. I was sweaty enough as it was without putting products all over my skin. I’d also probably leave the lipsticks behind next time and just rock a lip gloss, as I didn’t wear those often, either.;;;;;;;;;

A dry bag: An essential for spending time out on the water. It meant I could put my camera in my dry bag, get some air in it so it floats, and swim off to a little beach with my camera and take some great photos. The extra air helped it to float, which was useful.;;;;;;;;;

Travel Insurance;;;;;;;;;
You definitely need travel insurance for your sailing trip. There’s an awful lot of ways to injure yourself on a boat — whether it’s with the anchor (Lindsay Lohan just lost half a finger to an anchor accident on board a yacht!), breaking your foot by kicking a cleat, getting rope burn, or falling overboard. I’ve used World Nomads as my travel insurance provider for four years and counting, and fully recommend them to travellers!;;;;;;;;;

It sounds ridiculous, I know.;;;;;;;;;
I mean, I travel for a living. I must get on a plane at least once a month, if not once a week at times. So why on earth has every flight I’ve taken felt like it was bringing me one step closer to death?;;;;;;;;;
It didn’t used to be this way.;;;;;;;;;
Back when I used to take a vacation once a year, I didn’t even think about the flights. I’d be mildly nervous during take-off, then spend the rest of the journey enamoured with the sensation of being so far above the ground.;;;;;;;;;
Funnily enough, once I started boarding planes regularly, my fear began to grow.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out exposure therapy was not the way forward for me.;;;;;;;;;
The more I travelled, the more scared I became.;;;;;;;;;
Coming in to land on a hazy morning in Muscat, Oman. I took this photo to distract me from what I thought was my impending doom.;;;;;;;;;
And what started off as slight jitters during the first few months of my travels turned into full-blown panic attacks by the end of the first year.;;;;;;;;;
It reached the point where during the week leading up to taking a flight, I’d have gruesome, graphic nightmares of being in a plane crash, which would then have me convinced it was a premonition and that I shouldn’t get on a plane. Then, during the flight, I’d spend the entire time replaying my nightmares and just waiting for us to start plummeting.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And yeah, I’d have panic attacks, too, spending many of my flights hyperventilating and crying behind sunglasses, digging my nails into my boyfriend’s arms — or my own if I was flying solo. I’d whimper and mutter about how I needed to get off the plane, and every time we safely landed, I’d resolve to never take another flight again.;;;;;;;;;
I couldn’t even eat in the 24 hours leading up to a flight because my stomach would be so nervous.;;;;;;;;;
The funny thing about all of this was my background in physics. I understand exactly how planes fly, I know how they stay up in the air, I realise they’re far safer than driving. I knew all the facts.;;;;;;;;;
A fear of flying, however, is entirely irrational.;;;;;;;;;
That time I was one of five passengers on an enormous plane: horrifying.;;;;;;;;;
Flash forward to today and my fear of flying has pretty much disappeared. I occasionally get nervous before a flight, but my fears are on a 2/10 level rather than the 9 that I’ve been for the past few years.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve even grown to enjoy it. I look forward to it. I think of it as a time to relax and rest and enjoy being disconnected from the outside world.;;;;;;;;;
Here’s how I did it.;;;;;;;;;
I Better Educated Myself;;;;;;;;;
I was at the airport in San Francisco when I decided to wander into a store and grab a couple of books for the flight. One of them was a copy of Cockpit Confidential, which sounded vaguely interesting. I’d never heard of it before.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I boarded my plane, opened it up, and began to read.;;;;;;;;;
And before we’d even started moving, my nerves were fading away.;;;;;;;;;
Written by Patrick Smith, a pilot and writer of the Ask the Pilot column for Salon, it covers basically every question you could possibly have about flying. And the fact that he’s so matter-of-fact about everything and makes even the most horrifying-sounding of situations (to me) appear as though it’s not a big deal in any way (because it actually isn’t) really set my mind at ease.;;;;;;;;;
I was enthralled on that flight and I didn’t look up once until we landed. Most importantly of all, I was so calm that I didn’t even have any butterflies during my flight. I was even starting to enjoying flying now that I understood it a lot more.;;;;;;;;;
That was the first flight of my life where I hadn’t experienced any nervousness.;;;;;;;;;
Well, I took that book around the world with me and I know it so well, I could probably recite half of it to you right now. I don’t carry it with me any more because my fear is over, but man. If there’s one thing I’ve done that’s eradicated my fear of flying, it’s that book. So, if you’re scared of flying, you need to buy it.;;;;;;;;;
I thought I was reasonably well-educated about flying, given that I have a masters in physics and all that jazz. But it turns out, understanding how a plane flies and stays up in the air wasn’t enough to keep me calm and rational. Instead, I found that having a pilot explain every single thing that happens when you fly and how none of it is scary or dangerous was exactly what I needed.;;;;;;;;;
There are two additional books that have significantly improved my flying experiences, and they’re both so different to Cockpit Confidential, as well as to each other. I strongly recommend buying all three to give yourself the best chance of completely overcoming your fear of flying. The two additional books are:;;;;;;;;;
Soar: The Breakthrough Treatment for Fear of Flying: What I love about this book is it’s all about the psychology behind having a fear of flying. It teaches you exactly why you have this fear, what is going on in your body when you experience anxiety in planes, and some incredible coping methods for when you’re up in the sky. This book is fantastic — and is particularly good at dampening down that anticipation anxiety when you’re wondering if you should cancel your trip. I recommend reading this book at least a week before your flight, if not longer, as some of the calming exercises can take a few days to kick in. ;;;;;;;;;
The Easy Way to Enjoy Flying: This book takes a totally different approach to Soar, and it’s one of my favourite books to read on the plane. Just a couple of months ago, I was flying from Christchurch to Melbourne and found myself starting to feel nervous on the plane. I picked up this book and within a few minutes, I felt totally calm again. This book is all about dispelling the most common myths around the safety of planes, and I benefitted a lot from reading each chapter as I experienced it on the plane. I read about take-offs during the take-off and turbulence during any bumpy bits. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I believe this three books work together to completely dispel a fear of flying. Soar teaches you why you have the anxiety and how to remove it, The Easy Way shares why flying is safe and why you shouldn’t panic, and Cockpit Confidential shows you exactly how amazing flying is and why you should be excited to step on board a plane. ;;;;;;;;;
I can’t recommend them enough. ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Headspaced My Fears Away;;;;;;;;;
If there’s one thing that’s made a huge difference to my mental health, it’s regularly using the meditation app Headspace to create a tiny sanctuary of calm in my frenzied brain. I try to squeeze in a 10-minute meditation session with Headspace both as soon as I wake up and before I go to bed, and it’s one of the biggest things I’ve tried to improve my mental state. Just having lower anxiety levels in general results in me feeling calmer and more rational when it comes to stepping on a plane.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Headspace actually has a fear of flying meditation program for nervous fliers, which helps to ground me and calm me down before a flight. I listen to it daily in the week running up to my departure, and then during take-off. I end up feeling like I’m on the verge of serene when the wheels lift up from the ground.;;;;;;;;;
You can try Headspace for free for 10 days, so it’s definitely worth checking out to see if those sessions help to reduce the overall anxiety in your life.;;;;;;;;;
I Took Dramamine or Benadryl for Naps;;;;;;;;;
I get motion sickness on planes, so I usually take a Dramamine or Benadryl before boarding anyway. And one bonus to this? They make me pretty drowsy so I end up spending most of my flight snoozing. There’s something about drowsiness that takes my anxiety away. All I’m thinking about is how much I want to have a nap. ;;;;;;;;;
A glass of wine always helps, too.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Love Checking Out Out Flight Radar 24 Before My Flight;;;;;;;;;
While I’m still in the airport, I load up Flight Radar 24 on my laptop and spend a few minutes looking at just how many thousands of planes there are in the sky at that moment. When I checked the map just now, there were a whopping 13,500 up in the air.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It always makes me feel better, because it shows me how insignificant my flight really is. There are so many planes in the sky at any one time and so many terrified passengers — none of whom are actually going to die.;;;;;;;;;
I love remembering that there are one million people in the sky on planes at any one time. I sometimes like to imagine all of those planes and passengers all travelling around the world in straight line, one after the other. Something about picturing us all travelling along together — and safely — makes me feel comforted. ;;;;;;;;;
What Are the Chances Of…?;;;;;;;;;
I knew the stats: your odds of dying in a plane crash are roughly one in 11 million; your odds of dying in a car crash are one in 5,000. Ninety-six per cent of plane crash passengers have survived. I’ve memorised them all. But knowing the numbers never really helped me while I was up in the air, because I was always convinced the plane I was on was the one that was heading down. Anxiety doesn’t listen to logic or reason, unfortunately.;;;;;;;;
So I have this weird little internal dialogue where I start mentally going through the chances of me being in a plane crash:;;;;;;;;;
“Right, so what are the chances of there even being a plane crash in the world today? That’s probably super-unlikely — there hasn’t been one for months. But let’s say there was a plane crash today — what are the chances that it would happen during the hour that I’m in the air? What are the chances it would be a Vueling flight? What are the chances it would be a plane that took off from Barcelona? What are the chances that it would be a flight that was heading to Lisbon? And even if it was a plane that was landing in Lisbon, there’s one of those every five minutes, so the chances even then are so low. What would be the chances of all of those things coming together and it being the flight I’m on?”;;;;;;;;;
For some reason, going over and over the minuscule chances of random things happening massively helps to calm me down.;;;;;;;;;
We’re all so insignificant. ;;;;;;;;;
I Remind Myself That Being on a Plane is the Safest Place I Could Possibly Be;;;;;;;;;
It’s true: while you’re sat on a flight and freaking out about how dangerous it feels, you’re pretty much in the safest place you could possibly be. Safer than crossing the street, taking a bath, playing a video game, or walking down the stairs.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’re so ridiculously safe on a plane — even though it doesn’t feel like it.;;;;;;;;;
I Stopped Speaking About It;;;;;;;;;
I used to spend the run-up to every departure constantly telling my boyfriend how nervous I was about having to get on a plane, but all that did was reiterate to myself that I was nervous about having to get on a plane.;;;;;;;;;
Instead, I tried telling him that I was excited to fly again, and I couldn’t wait to get on a plane. I told him that I couldn’t believe how little anxiety I had about flying this time around.;;;;;;;;;
Having a much more positive mindset, even though I was absolutely lying, helped calm my nerves. Repeating over and over that I wasn’t nervous made me start to believe it. I highly recommend doing this in the run-up to your flight.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Surround Myself With Technology;;;;;;;;;
I’ve found that one of the best ways to get over a fear of flying is to distract yourself like crazy on the flight, so I take it to the extreme by carrying all of my tech on the plane with me. After we take off and I’ve finished listening to Headspace, I throw my headphones on and listen to music, while also reading my Kindle or playing a game on my phone. Or I’ll watch a TV show on my laptop. Or I’ll write a blog post.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I’ll usually sit by the window and close the blind, too, and that way, I can trick my mind that I’m on a train instead.;;;;;;;;;
I Give Myself Exactly 30 Seconds to Panic;;;;;;;;;
For me, the most anxiety-inducing parts of the flight are the take-off and turbulence. Whenever I start to panic, I remind myself that I can’t change anything and then tell myself that I am allowed to freak out for exactly 30 seconds. As the panic rises in my throat, I slowly count down from 30, and when I reach 0, I take a slow, deep breath, drop my shoulders, unclench my jaw, and force myself to relax.;;;;;;;;;
It really does help keep me calm at a time when I’d usually be grabbing at armrests and chewing my lip to pieces.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Create a Flying Playlist;;;;;;;;;
A flying playlist helps a ton, and I have an enormous one full of my favourite songs. They’re ones that never fail to pump me up and fill me with confidence and energy, which definitely helps me to stop focusing on whether an engine is about to explode or not.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Visualise Where I’m Going;;;;;;;;;
Finally, I love to spend my time in the air visualising my destination. If I’m feeling nervous, I’ll start picturing me lying on the beach or climbing a mountain or exploring a brand new city. If I do it for long enough, the excitement starts to overtake the terror.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
Do you have any tips for overcoming a fear of flying?;;;;;;;;;

I, however, am petty and don’t like being told what to do. When he told me my backup system was atrocious, I set out to prove him wrong.;;;;;;;;;
And then I lost all of my photos from Guatemala.;;;;;;;;;
Watching the sunrise at Tikal — one of the most magical moments of my life — is something I can only recapture through my memories.;;;;;;;;;
How did I lose those photos? By leaving my SD card in my Macbook for days on end. When I then dropped my laptop on the floor, it landed on the SD card and sent it shattering across the room.;;;;;;;;;
Goodbye to any photos I hadn’t backed up.;;;;;;;;;
One of three photos I have from my time in Guatemala;;;;;;;;;
There was also the time my hard drive broke because I’d just chucked it to the bottom of my backpack and I lost several months of photos.;;;;;;;;;
And that time I dropped my phone in the toilet and lost two weeks’ worth of photos.;;;;;;;;;
So needless to say, I’ve had my fair share of photo disasters, and while it might sound like I’m blasé about it all, I’m not. It’s absolutely devastating to lose photos of your travels, and I’ve been gutted each and every time it’s happened.;;;;;;;;;
So, I finally made a change and I’ve now found a system that works for lazy-yet-optimistic-people-who-never-believe-it’ll-happen-to-them like me.;;;;;;;;;

You Need Crashplan in Your Life;;;;;;;;;
One of my absolute travel essentials these days is Crashplan, and I can’t recommend it highly enough.;;;;;;;;;
For $5 a month, Crashplan offers an online backup service with unlimited storage. Unlike services like Dropbox, Crashplan backs up your entire laptop continuously in the background, without you having to do anything from your end.;;;;;;;;;
You simply download the app, set it to back up either everything, or just certain folders, and then you’re set forever. It’ll now run in the background, checking for new files every few minutes and backing them up for you. It’s also super-secure with some of the strongest file encryption of any backup service.;;;;;;;;;
If your laptop breaks, or is stolen, or you accidentally delete anything, you can just head to Crashplan and download anything you need.;;;;;;;;;
Even better: if you delete anything from your laptop — say you’ve taken so many photos that you’ve run out of space on your hard drive — Crashplan doesn’t delete it from their storage. So it’ll be there, in the cloud and waiting for you, forever. Most other online backup services delete your files after 30 days of them being removed from your laptop.;;;;;;;;;
So basically, if every single piece of technology I owned was stolen tomorrow — my laptop, my phone, my camera, my SD cards, my external hard drive — I wouldn’t be in any way screwed. Well, apart from having to replace all of that! But with Crashplan, I could buy a brand new laptop, and restore all of my data from the cloud. It might take a long time (especially if you don’t have a fast internet connection), but eventually my new laptop would have exactly the same stuff on it as my old one — including all of those travel photos.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The only downside to using it is the initial backing-up process, which can take weeks on a slow connection. I first got Crashplan while I was island hopping in Thailand and I think it took six weeks to complete that initial backup. If possible, it’s definitely worth signing up for it before you leave, so you can have everything backed up already.;;;;;;;;;
Honestly, Crashplan really is one of the best things I’ve ever invested in. I’m so lazy that I always forget to back stuff up, and even when I do remember, half the time I put it off because I can’t be bothered. Knowing that Crashplan is always running in the background and backing up my stuff to keep it safe gives me such peace of mind.;;;;;;;;;
Plus an External Hard Drive;;;;;;;;;
Crashplan has you covered if you ever lose your laptop or accidentally delete your photos, but what if that happens while you’re travelling through somewhere like Burma, where I managed to download just three emails over the space of 14 hours?;;;;;;;;;
If you’re going to be moving around lots and don’t have any guarantees about internet speeds, it’s best to have an external hard drive that contains all of your photos as well. That way if you do need to access them at any point and don’t have an internet connection, it’ll be easy to do so with your external hard drive.;;;;;;;;;
Alternatively, you could bring a handful of SD cards on your trip and never delete your photos from them. Instead, when the card gets full, you could switch it out for a new one. I travel with this small, cheap case for my SD cards, which keeps them dry and protected in my backpack.;;;;;;;;;
I’ve set a reminder on my laptop to tell me to back everything up to my hard drive once a month, so that I don’t forget.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
How do you keep your photos safe while travelling?;;;;;;;;;

Sharing the bad things that happen to me each year is one of my favourite things to do. I receive a lot of emails telling me I’m living the perfect life, but at times, it feels like I stumble from one near-death experience to the next. This life of travel isn’t always amazing, and I have far more unfortunate experiences on the road than any other backpacker I’ve met. I think it’s important to talk about them in order to give a more realistic view of travel than the beach and sunset photos. 2015, in particular, has been a tough one.;;;;;;;;;
Here, then, are my worst moments from the past 12 months!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Rediscovered Hayfever and Had My Eye Swell Shut;;;;;;;;;
Let’s start with an attractive photo of me!;;;;;;;;;
I used to struggle every year with hayfever, but when I left the UK, my allergies faded away. I almost managed to forget they existed for a while. Well, that is until I returned to Cornwall at the height of summer and spent two weeks sneezing my way through our road trip.;;;;;;;;;
The worst attack had to be the day I went for a walk along the coast outside of Perranporth. After an hour of explorations, Dave and I came across an amazing patch of grass that was thick and cloud-like. I dove straight in and spent the next hour sunbathing in my soft little grass mattress. By the time we returned back to our apartment, I couldn’t see out of one eye and it had swollen to epic proportions. It took almost 24 hours for it to calm back down again.;;;;;;;;;

I Got Bed Bugs in Estonia;;;;;;;;;
I’ve been fortunate to have spent the past four years travelling full-time and not yet come up against bed bugs. Until Tallinn, that is.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At first, I thought it was mosquito bites. I awoke on my first morning in the city with a dozen itchy red bites all over my legs and thought I must have slept outside of the covers. No big deal.;;;;;;;;;
On the second morning, I awoke with 132. They were big and red and itchy and clustered into groups of three. One quick google search told me all I needed to know: I had bed bugs. And so began a 48 hour quest to rid myself of them.;;;;;;;;;
Did you know that to kill bedbugs you have to subject them to temperatures greater than 45 degrees Celsius, or lower than -20 for a minimum of 48 hours? I found myself lost in reports of people who accidentally brought bed bugs into their home after a trip abroad and ended up spending $15,000 to fumigate their entire house because nothing else will kill them all. I read about how, if the bugs can’t find a way into your bed at night, they’ll crawl up onto the ceiling and parachute down to feed. Bed bugs are the WORST and they’re so hard to get rid of.;;;;;;;;;
I took the ferry to Helsinki on the morning of my discovery and spent my first day doing everything I could to make sure the bugs were well and truly gone. I had every item of clothing I owned washed and dried by my hotel. I soaked everything else in the bathroom sink, using the kettle to make sure the water was hot enough. I used the hairdryer to blast anything that I couldn’t get wet, including every page of the three books I was travelling with.;;;;;;;;;
Oh, and the bites were so itchy (especially the one on the bottom of my foot!) that I could barely walk around Helsinki and saw so little of it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Two Nights of Vomit in a Row;;;;;;;;;
I awoke in Riga to the sound of a girl throwing up in the middle of the dorm. It was 2 a.m. and she had just returned from the hostel’s pub crawl. The sound. The smell. She refused to go to the bathroom and instead spent the next hour loudly retching in the bunk below mine. I didn’t sleep well that night.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I checked out the following day and took the bus to Tallinn. On my first night there, I awoke to the violent rattling of my bed as this enormous Russian man struggled to clamber into the top bunk. Three minutes later, I heard an almighty retch and that same splattering sound again.;;;;;;;;;
No.;;;;;;;;;
I ran to the light switch. The man was covered in splatters of dark purple vomit and was staring at me in bewilderment. He blinked twice, and then he fell asleep in it. By the way, THIS WAS ALSO THE HOSTEL WITH THE BED BUGS.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Sliced the Top of My Finger Off;;;;;;;;;
I still don’t know what happened.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was in the middle of our Cornwall road trip, and I was rummaging in my backpack for something. As I rifled around inside, I felt an intensely sharp pain in the tip of finger, like how I imagine it would feel to have an electric shock. I whipped back my arm and was horrified to discover my entire hand was covered in blood. What had just happened?;;;;;;;;;
I ran to the bathroom and grimaced as I washed my finger under the tap. Squinting through the crimson, I noticed that the top of my finger had been sliced clean off. That serves me right for leaving (I think) razor blades loose in the bottom of my pack.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Forgot to Apply for My Australian Visa. Again;;;;;;;;;
It was twelve hours before my flight to Melbourne when Dave asked if I had remembered to apply for my visa.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Damn it.;;;;;;;;;
That would be no. ;;;;;;;;;
And maybe it would be excusable if I hadn’t done the exact same thing the last time I flew into Australia.;;;;;;;;;
Cue 12 hours of panic as I attempted to get my visa in time. While friends told me it was instantly approved for them, my eVisitor visa still wasn’t in my inbox by the time we headed to the airport in Taipei. At the check-in desks, they told me I didn’t have a visa and wouldn’t be allowed on the plane. They said the eVisitor visa takes ten working days to be approved and I should apply for an ETA instead.;;;;;;;;;
But on the Australian ETA website, it said that British passport holders weren’t entitled to apply for it online and I had to do so in person at a travel agent. Panicked and flustered, I checked-in for the first half of my flight — to Manila — and figured I’d work something out there. Or end up spending Christmas alone in the Philippines. When I landed at the airport, my visa still hadn’t been approved.;;;;;;;;;
I crossed my fingers and found a dodgy sounding website called Easy ETA that promised to apply for it and approve the visa within 20 minutes. I paid the $60 fee and wondered if I’d just given my money away to scammers.;;;;;;;;;
But, it worked! My visa was in my inbox in 18 minutes and I made my flight to Melbourne!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Breakdown;;;;;;;;;
I can’t write about my worst moments of the year without mentioning my breakdown. Writing and editing my book in just three months was a big mistake. My tight deadline had me powering through 18 hour work days with little sleep, unable to even justify showering or stepping outside. It was no wonder I emerged feeling broken.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
At first, I struggled with small things, overwhelmed with social anxiety after spending three straight months inside. Then it progressed into full-blown panic attacks. From then, things got even worse. I cancelled on friends. I stopped replying to emails. I stopped going outside. I stopped eating. I had panic attacks over seeing other people, and when I did see them, I struggled to even think of something to say.;;;;;;;;;
I struggled to leave my comfort zone. I struggled with everything. I cancelled my dream trip to the Seychelles, Mauritius, and the Maldives, losing thousands of dollars in the process because I was too anxious to get on the plane. I’m not sure I’ve had a single day this year where I haven’t cried.;;;;;;;;;
The good news is: I’m slowly getting better, and it’s made me feel more normal to talk to author friends and discover they went through something similar and it took them well over a year to recover. I’m about half-way back to my non-anxious self.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Had to Cancel My Scandinavia Trip;;;;;;;;;
I knew exactly when I would need to hand in the final-final-final draft of How Not to Travel the World, so planned an action-packed solo travel adventure through Scandinavia as a celebratory treat. I booked myself into first-class carriages on trains, splashed out on private rooms, and then suddenly, I couldn’t go.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
There had been a month-long delay in receiving some edits back from my publisher, and then I had taken just as long to go through them. I should have learned by that point that publishing a book never goes smoothly. Frustratingly, I had to start work on the final edit of my manuscript just as I was due to leave for Copenhagen.;;;;;;;;;
I knew I wouldn’t be able to spend any time exploring when I had so much to do, so I cancelled everything, lost a lot of money, and flew home to work on my book instead.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
A Week of Rain in Norway;;;;;;;;;
Norway looks like one of the prettiest countries in the world, but you wouldn’t know it from my photos: they’re all so grey and rainy. We visited Norway during one of its wettest summers ever and cursed ourselves for choosing to visit Bergen, the rainiest city in Europe. We even had hailstones! In June!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I try not to let the weather affect my opinion of a place, but it was tough in Norway. It rained every single day, we couldn’t do any of the hikes we’d planned, our fjord trip was all about the cold and clouds, and even our train ride — supposedly the prettiest in the world — was washed out and dull.;;;;;;;;;
I can’t believe I left feeling so ambivalent about a country I was expecting to fall in love with.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The Crappy Airbnb Host in Cornwall;;;;;;;;;
My parents generously treated me to a stay in a fancy hotel in St Ives this summer and, after Dave and I fell in love with the town, we decided to stay a little longer. We found a cute shepherd’s hut on Airbnb and booked ourselves in.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And then, the most annoying day.;;;;;;;;;
We checked out of our hotel at 10 and had two hours to kill until we could check in to the hut. We waited it out in a restaurant, then drove to meet the owner.;;;;;;;;;
Nobody was there. Everything was locked and there was no sign of life. It started to rain.;;;;;;;;;
Dave and I sat in the car trying and failing to get hold of our host. When we finally got through to him, after half an hour of trying, he told us he’d forgotten we were moving in, was three hours away, and his cleaner was sick. He then told us to go explore St Ives and return three hours later. Despite having seen everything there was to see in the town and having zero desire to explore in the rain, we drove back and spent our time in a pub.;;;;;;;;;
We returned an hour later than asked, met the owner, and he told us he hadn’t even started cleaning our hut yet, so why don’t we go for a walk in the fields for an hour until he’s done? We did as he suggested and trudged miserably through the countryside, drenched and frustrated. An hour later, we returned and he still hadn’t started. We spent the next hour waiting in the car.;;;;;;;;;
And when we finally got inside? I tried to fill up a hot water bottle from the kettle and poured boiling water all over my hand instead. Fabulous.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Was Far Too Ambitious in the Baltics;;;;;;;;;
I always do it: when faced with the prospect of a fixed-length trip, I start panicking that I won’t be able to see enough and immediately plan an exhausting trip that goes to as many places as possible.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I originally planned to spend two weeks in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, but when I had such bad and vomity luck in the first two countries, I fled to Finland instead.;;;;;;;;;
While in Helsinki, I decided to fly to Stockholm to try and make up for cancelling my trip there earlier this year. After spending a couple of days there, I had three days left until I was due to fly out of Warsaw. I should have spent them all in Stockholm. Instead I flew to Vilnius, rushed around for two days, and took a bus to Warsaw, leaving having not seen much of, well, anywhere.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Bangkok Airways Ripped a Hole in My Backpack;;;;;;;;;
I landed at Trat Airport and pulled my backpack onto my shoulders. I began to walk away and stood on a nail polish bottle. That was weird. I bent over to take a closer look and realised it was my nail polish. As I picked it up, a bottle of sunscreen fell to my feet. That was really weird.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I reached around to see if one of my zips was undone and put my hand through the gaping hole in my pack. Somehow, someone had managed to tear a hole in the side of my bag and all of my belongings were currently clattering onto the ground beside me. Bangkok Airways were useless — they offered me $30 to buy a replacement pack[!] and tried to stick it back together with sellotape.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, I always travel with Osprey backpacks, which come with a lifetime guarantee — they’ll replace or repair their packs for any reason at any time. I duct taped up the hole and when I got to Melbourne a few months later, got it repaired with just a few days’ turnaround.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Battling Eating Issues in Porto;;;;;;;;;
When I arrived in Porto, a month before my book was due to launch, my anxiety was through the roof. And one really cool side effect of having panic attacks multiple times a day? Not being able to eat.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I spent my week in Porto panicking over mealtimes instead of strolling happily around the city. Dinners involved me ordering the smallest dish on the menu, taking a couple of tiny mouthfuls, then handing it to Dave to finish. There were so many Portuguese dishes I wanted to try, but the thought of food turned my stomach until I couldn’t face even putting anything in my mouth.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, these eating issues were short-lived and passed when I moved on to Madrid. Praise the jamon!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Left My Passport Behind in Brixton;;;;;;;;;
Like applying for my Australian visa, this wasn’t the first time I’d done this. I’d just spent a wonderful month in Brixton and was back at my parents, packing my bags in preparation for my early morning flight the next day.;;;;;;;;;
Just before going to sleep, I checked my phone and found a series of frantic messages from my Airbnb host. I’d left my passport behind in the apartment.;;;;;;;;;
Man alive!;;;;;;;;;
I’ll forever be grateful to my mum for getting in her car and taking two hours out of her evening to drive me to the apartment so I could collect it.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Smashed a Hole in the Wall of My Airbnb Apartment in Granada;;;;;;;;;
Our bedroom in Granada had these big wooden shutters over the windows that opened up on the inside of the room. One morning, I was crouched beneath one and forgot it was there. I stood up and watched in horror as it flew in a graceful arc across the room and into the wall.;;;;;;;;;
“What was that?” Dave yelled from downstairs.;;;;;;;;;
“Nothing,” I called back.;;;;;;;;;
He ran upstairs and found me covered from head to toe in plaster with a gaping hole in the wall and the shutter resting beside my feet.;;;;;;;;;
The good news? Nothing happens quickly in Spain — or at all! — and after explaining what had happened to our apartment owner and offering to pay to have the hole fixed, he did nothing. He never came to look at it and I wasn’t out of pocket. Score!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Dave Fell on My Head and Gave Me Concussion;;;;;;;;;
Haha! Dave and I were half-way through our 5 km obstacle race when it happened. We were running across a giant inflatable section, which was covered things to climb over and around. I lost my footing as I scrambled over one of the obstacles and landed sprawled out on the ground. Unfortunately, Dave did exactly the same. He came flying over the top and landed elbow-first onto my head.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I screamed, dragged myself to my feet, and continued running. Except, I kind of really needed to vomit. And when I looked at the ground, it was spinning around and looking as though it was heading up to meet my face. I had to walk the final third of the course because I felt so terrible.;;;;;;;;;
 ;;;;;;;;;
And that was the year! 2015 has been an odd one for me, but I’m ready to move on and I’m looking forward to making some positive changes that’ll hopefully lessen the bad luck next year.;;;;;;;;;

Dave and I knew a couple who had recently made the city their home, and, as we were looking to find a base somewhere in Europe but hadn’t yet decided where, we dropped them a message to find out what they liked about it.;;;;;;;;;
When we received a gushing response back, essentially describing a place that ticked every single box we had on our dream city checklist, we booked a flight from Miami and a month-long stay in an Airbnb apartment.;;;;;;;;;
We were giving ourselves a month to explore the city and see if it could potentially work as a base for us.;;;;;;;;;
Neither of us had ever even been to Lisbon before.;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon’s Alfama neighbourhood;;;;;;;;;
It took exactly three days.;;;;;;;;;
On our third day in the city, we turned to each other, head over heels in love with this city and knew this was exactly what we had been looking for.;;;;;;;;;
I’ll go into more depth about why we love Lisbon later this month, but to sum it up: it’s inexpensive; it’s beautiful; English is widely spoken; the weather’s great; the locals are lovely and welcoming; it’s close to a beach; the food scene is incredible; there’s a thriving start-up scene; we have lots of friends here; it’s close to an international airport.
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
It was perfect for us, and I wasn’t even the slightest bit apprehensive about deciding to stay there for longer. I was ready to have a familiar place to return to between my travels.;;;;;;;;;
Now we just had to find an apartment.;;;;;;;;;
Views from Lisbon’s castle;;;;;;;;;
We gave ourselves a month to find our dream apartment, which felt like a decent amount of time, especially after chatting with friends who lived in Lisbon and had picked up bargains in a short time on their places. €900/month for a 100sqm two-bedroom apartment; €700/month for a 75sqm one-bedroom apartment.;;;;;;;;
We gave ourselves a budget of €1000 (around $1100) a month for a two-bedroom place in a central location, and started hunting. We spoke with both our local Portuguese friends and digital nomad friends to find out which sites were best to search, looked at them all, and promptly realised there was absolutely nothing.;;;;;;;;;
We would be looking at either €1000/month for a dark, dingy, one-bedroom apartment in a crappy neighbourhood, or €2000/month for exactly what we were looking for.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
And this totally felt like karma.;;;;;;;;;
Lisbon Cathedral at night;;;;;;;;;
Because Airbnb has screwed Lisbon so much.;;;;;;;;;
It turns out that if locals put their apartment up on Airbnb for three months over summer, there’ll make more money than they would renting it out to a local for an entire year. So why list it anywhere but Airbnb?;;;;;;;;;
For us, though, and many locals in Lisbon, when it comes to renting an apartment, they’re incredibly expensive relative to the price of everything else in the country, and places are snapped up within minutes.;;;;;;;;;
Few of our Portuguese friends can afford to live in the centre of the city any more. We no longer believed we could afford to live there.;;;;;;;;;
I had ten tabs of apartment listings open in my browser for weeks and I did no work over that time. All I did was sit and refresh all of them every five minutes, and there was nothing. Whenever we found an apartment that looked nice, we’d email them within half an hour of the listing going live and hear that it had already been taken by someone.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I got to witness first-hand the downside to Airbnb and it had me seriously rethinking my use of them.;;;;;;;;;
(Side note: after three awful experiences in a row with Airbnb recently, I’ve actually sworn off them for good [aside from using my referral credit up]. It’s hostels and hotels all the way for me now!);;;;;;;;;
Lisbon’s famous trams;;;;;;;;;
We started looking at alternatives, because our month in Lisbon was rapidly drawing to a close and we hadn’t even looked at a single apartment. Granada was cheap, but we hadn’t liked it that much; we liked Madrid but didn’t know many people there; we loved Amsterdam, but apartment-hunting sounded like it would be even more competitive there; we couldn’t afford London; we knew tons of people in Berlin, but did we want to spend winters there?;;;;;
Nowhere felt right but Lisbon, and we were devastated we couldn’t find anywhere to stay.;;;;;;;;;
Then: a hope.;;;;;;;;;
A beautiful apartment that had everything we wanted and was within our budget. The apartment was listed at midnight and I sent the real estate agent an enquiry immediately.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
The next morning, we turned up for our viewing and found out that five people had already also arranged to see the apartment today. As the guy showed us around the apartment, his phone didn’t stop ringing with more people wanting to see it, too. This was going to be vicious.;;;;;;;;;
Fortunately, the owner of our Airbnb apartment knew the owners of this apartment, and also knew that they happened to be travel bloggers, too. That was our in! We wrote a kickass pitch to convince the owners we would be the best possible candidates and was thrilled when they chose us.;;;;;;;;;
A few days later, we collected our keys.;;;;;;;;;

And while that craziness was going on, we somehow managed to find the time to road trip around Portugal with some friends. This month, we checked out Nazare, home to the biggest wave ever surfed:;;;;;;;;;

 Obidos, a medieval walled town that’s famous for its ginjinha — a cherry liqueur that’s drunk from a chocolate cup.;;;;;;;;;

And Alcobaça, where you can find the stunning Alcobaça Monastery, built in the 12th century and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.;;;;;;;;;

This is one of my favourite countries on the planet and I can’t recommend it highly enough. I had such a wonderful trip that I’m actually excited to have hit the pause buttons on my travels — just so I can start sharing the fantastic experiences I had.;;;;;;;;;
After just two weeks in the country, I’m fully obsessed with Mozambique and can’t stop talking about how hard I’ve fallen for the beaches, the people, the snorkelling, the food, and the laid-back way of life. I spent my first trip exploring the more popular southern parts, and now I’m already putting together plans to explore the north.;;;;;;;;;
But let’s talk about expenses.;;;;;;;;;
Finances-wise, I wasn’t sure what to expect from Mozambique. I hadn’t travelled extensively in Africa when I visited, and I’d heard that much of the continent is pricey for budget travellers. I landed in Maputo, then, expecting prices to be similar to Western Europe, and ended up pleasantly surprised.;;;;;;;;;
As someone who was travelling solo and on a mid-range budget, I didn’t find the prices to be too outrageous and even managed to squeeze some luxury into my trip.;;;;;;;;;
Let’s start looking at my budget breakdown for Mozambique!;;;;;;;;;
All prices are listed in this post are in U.S. dollars, as always, as that’s where most of you guys are from.;;;;;;;;;
My private hut at Baobab Backpackers, in Vilanculos. I loved this guesthouse so much!;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Accommodation in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
The value of accommodation in Mozambique varied quite a bit, depending on which part of the country you were in. Outside of dorm rooms, it was tough to find a well-reviewed guesthouse in Maputo for under $40 a night, but in Tofo and Vilanculos, budget options were everywhere (although didn’t always have amazing reviews).;;;;;;;;;

For those of you who want to visit Mozambique on a shoestring, camping is common and can be done in most tourist spots, and especially in the south of the country. There isn’t a Couchsurfing scene at all in Mozambique, so don’t rely on that if you’re used to bouncing your way from sofa to sofa as you travel. There are hostels, and dorm rooms are cheap. The infamous Fatima’s (around $8.50 per night for a dorm) is your best option in Maputo and Tofo, although both places get pretty mixed reviews.;;;;;;;;;
What I did: I opted for a real mix of accommodation options. I stayed in the best-sounding budget-hotel in Maputo, splashed out on a luxury eco resort in Tofo, and stayed in a popular hostel in Vilanculos. While quality did vary, the one constant was the bugs and the lack of air conditioning.;;;;;;;;;
Taka-Taka Hotel, Maputo: $37.94/night;;;;;;;;;
This is most likely the best value guesthouse you’ll find in Maputo, which was pretty expensive for accommodation. The guesthouse was basic but clean, the staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfasts were free and decent, and it was in a central location. ;;;;;;;;;
There was one major downside to this hotel, though. One of the guests who was staying there went to reception and asked what room I was in, and they told him! I had never even seen this guy before, let alone spoke to him. He turned up outside my room at 10 p.m., tried to get inside, and once I got rid of him, continued to knock on my door to invite me to drink with him or introduce his friend to me. I slept with the room furniture up against the door that night and was relieved to be checking out the following day. Ugh. ;;;;;;;;;
 Baia Sonambula, Tofo: $63.00/night;;;;;;;;;
One of the best places I’ve ever stayed in and such great value for money! If you want a bit of luxury travel in Mozambique, stay at Baia Sonambula. The staff are incredible, it’s located just up from the beach, the rooms are gorgeous, the views are the best, the breakfasts are divine, and you even get free cake and coconut water every afternoon. I spent five nights and considered cancelling the rest of my trip in order to spend even longer there. I’m currently trying to convince Dave to take a trip to Mozambique with me and it’s mostly so that I have an excuse to return to Baia Sonambula. ;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
 Baobab Backpackers, Vilanculos: $31.23/night;;;;;;;;;
Baobab Backpackers is a standard backpackers hangout on the beach. It’s rustic, there are cockroaches, and the rooms are hot and humid. If, however, you’re looking for a chilled out spot on the beach to make friends and be well-looked after, this is the place for you! Despite the relative discomforts (especially after my stay at Baia Sonambula), I really liked it and would stay here again. Lots of activities and excursions for you to take, there’s a restaurant on-site, which is useful if you’re feeling lazy, and the staff are so, so lovely. ;;;;;;;;;
Total cost for accommodation in Mozambique: $522.51 over 11 days = $47.50 per day.;;;;;;;;;
A dhow in Vilanculos;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Transportation in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
Transportation is unbelievably inexpensive if you’re willing to suck it up and ride the chapas. To quote from my post about what it’s like to travel in Mozambique: Imagine a humid minivan with poor suspension, swerving its way over pot-holed roads on a thirty-degree day. Now imagine filling it with 10 times more people than the recommended capacity until you’re all packed in the back like sweaty sardines. Maybe throw a child on your lap, a broken seat below your legs, and some smelly food in there, too. Now, get the driver to rip you off on the price.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Before arriving in the country, I planned to travel overland from place to place to save money, but it only took two days for me hand in my backpacker card and swear off using them. Unfortunately, though, if you’re not willing to use the chapas, don’t want to hitchhike, and don’t want to rent a car, there aren’t many other inexpensive overland transport options you can take.;;;;;;;;;
So, yeah. I definitely splurged on transportation on this trip. I flew from Maputo to Inhambane for $100, then took a free hotel shuttle to Tofo (the entire journey would have been around $12 total by chapa), then to get from Tofo to Vilanculos, I splurged on hiring a private car after finding out the overland journey would involve a ferry, multiple chapas, and many hours stood alone on the side of the road attempting to flag a ride down. I didn’t feel comfortable hitchhiking as a solo woman.;;;;;;;;;
Cities and towns in Mozambique are small, so you can walk basically everywhere you need to. I explored Maputo and Tofo on foot, and took tuk-tuks in Vilanculos in the evenings for safety reasons (the guesthouse staff told us it was unsafe to walk around at night). It cost around $1-2 each way to most places in the town.;;;;;;;;;
Flight from Maputo to Tofo: $100;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Private car transfer from Tofo to Vilanculos: $100;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Three tuk-tuk rides: $5;;;;;;;;;
My total cost for transportation in Mozambique: $205;;;;;;;;;
The fantastic restaurants and bars in Tofo;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Food in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
Food is cheap, cheap, cheap and delicious in Mozambique, and you definitely won’t go hungry. Portions were huge!;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;

It was super-common for breakfasts to be included in the price of your room, and they were all pretty standard breakfast fare of toast, butter, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and coffee. Baobab Backpackers didn’t include breakfast but had a restaurant on site where you could grab an enormous omelette before hitting the sandbanks.;;;;;;;;;
In Mozambique, you’ll find peri-peri-smothered everything and the enormous seafood platters will fill your stomach. Yes, if you’re not a fan of heat or seafood, you may find yourself having to hang out in tourist restaurants every now and then. The seafood is delicious, though, with some of the best prawns and crayfish I’ve ever had the pleasure of eating and some seriously great deals. A seafood platter split with two friends came to $6 each in Vilanculos, and was washed down with a $2 beer.;;;;;;;;;
Overall, expect to spend $2-7 per meal.;;;;;;;;;
For something local that’s without Portuguese influence, there’s a dish called matapa, which is stewed cassava leaves, cooked with seafood and covered with peanuts, garlic, and coconut milk. I didn’t try it because I can’t eat peanuts, but friends who did liked it more than they expected.;;;;;;;;;
Drinkingwise, I used my Grayl water purifier bottle that kills 99.999% of all viruses, bacteria, and cysts in water, making it completely safe to drink. I drank the tap water everywhere in Mozambique, didn’t get sick, saved money on water bottles, and didn’t pollute the country with my plastic waste. I highly recommend grabbing one of these for your trip. If you’re short on space, a Steripen is a great option for making tap water drinkable.;;;;;;;;;
Fruit is insanely cheap in Mozambique, and especially if you eat multiple portions of it a day — you’ll find deals like 30 mangoes for $0.20 while you’re wandering around the markets, and the locals will be bemused if you want to buy just one.;;;;;;;;;
I spent just $62 on food during my 11 days in the country. That’s $5.63 per day! ;;;;;;;;;

Beach wanderings on an island close to Vilanculos. Ah, I love this country so much!;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Activities in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
To save money on activities in Mozambique, you should plan to wait until after you’ve arrived in the country to start booking experiences. Like many places around the world, the prices listed online for tours and activities are drastically higher than what you’ll pay by turning up and asking around.;;;;;;;;;
It’s worth mentioning, too, that if you’re a solo traveller, you’ll find it beneficial to stay in hostels and take advantage of the group tours that are run for travellers. When looking at tours outside of my accommodation, group tours were rare and private ones charged at least twice as much if you were alone.;;;;;;;;;
So what trips did I take?;;;;;;;;;
In Tofo, I jumped on an ocean safari with Diversity SCUBA for a morning with the whale sharks. The ocean safari is aimed at the rare non-divers who opt to travel to Tofo, and involves spending two hours motoring across the ocean and jumping in whenever you spot whale sharks, manta rays, dolphins, and whales. It’s $40 for the tour, and I received a 10% discount because I was staying at Baia Sonambula. If you are a diver, you’ll pay $40 for a single tank.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
In Vilanculos, I opted for an island excursion that was arranged through Baobab Backpackers. It cost $50 to spend a full day on Ilha de Magaruque and included snorkelling equipment and a fish barbecue lunch. This was my favourite experience in Mozambique and well worth the money I spent! I wish I’d had longer in Vilanculos so I could have jumped on another one of their tours.;;;;;;;;;
In Mozambique, it is possible to rock up and negotiate with the local fishermen to hire a dhow for the day at a cheaper price, but you’re taking a risk by doing so. Hotel staff warned me of the dangers of doing this (potentially to convince me to take their tours) and said that the fishermen could take you out to an island, then ask for more money to bring you back.;;;;;;;;;
Mozambican meticais: I loved how colourful the banknotes were!;;;;;;;;;
The Cost of Miscellaneous Stuff in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
Visas: The Mozambique visa is reasonably pricey at $77 for a single entry tourist visa. Citizens of all countries can get a visa on arrival as  long as you can prove you’re a tourist (print out of a copy of your flight out of the country and accommodation confirmations). Members of SADC countries don’t require a tourist visa when visiting Mozambique.;;;;;;;;;

Anti-malarial tablets: Mozambique was the first country where I took anti-malarials! The country has one of the highest risks of malaria in the world, and cerebral malaria is common, so you’ll really want to make sure you take anti-malarials and take them properly. I opted for generic Malarone tablets, which were $2.42 per tablet. Doxycycline is a much cheaper alternative at $0.19 per tablet, but requires you to also take the tablets daily for a month after you leave the country and is an antibiotic, which I definitely didn’t want in my system.;;;;;;;;;
Travel insurance: I was paranoid about crime and safety in Mozambique after reading so many horror stories online, so I made sure to get the absolute best coverage I could from World Nomads. I opted for an explorer plan, which covered me against the highest amount of eventualities and had me paying the lowest amount of excess. I also added personal items cover for my laptop or camera after reading that theft was the most likely thing travellers were to come up against. I travelled through the country incident-free and felt far safer than I expected, so would probably opt for the standard lowest-cost policy when returning to Mozambique in the future.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Things to Know About Money in Mozambique;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
You’ll pay for most things in Mozambican Meticals (pronounced meti-caish), but the South African rand and U.S. dollars are widely accepted, too.;;;;;;;;;
ATMs often run out of cash, and some of them just wouldn’t work with my Visa debit card, so if you can’t get money out of the first one you try, don’t panic! Try a few others before concluding that your card has been blocked.;;;;;;;;;
Expect to pay with cash in restaurants, but all accommodation I stayed at had card readers, and so did the tour companies.;;;;;;;;;
Tipping isn’t expected. I like to tip a small amount anyway.;;;;;;;;;
You can’t change meticals outside of the country! I forgot about this and took a whopping $150 worth of meticals out of Mozambique with me, turned up in South Africa, and discovered nobody would change them. Fortunately-ish, Portuguese currency exchange places do change meticals, but at an appallingly bad rate. I got just $70 for mine once I landed back in Lisbon. If you don’t live in Portugal, though, don’t expect you’ll be able to change your money once you’ve left.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
And that’s how much it costs to travel in Mozambique! I spent around $950 for my 11 days in the country, which works out at $86 per day.;;;;;;;;;
It’s not the cheapest country in the world, but it’s far from the most expensive, either.;;;;;;;;;
I wasn’t making much of an effort to keep my expenses down, so if you’re happy to stay in hostels, eat cheaply, travel overland, and minimise the number of activities you do, you could most likely travel around for as little as $20 or 30 a day.;;;;;;;;;

Raiatea sounded like my kind of island: It looked beautiful from the aerial shots I’d seen of the island and its lagoon; it had a fascinating history — it’s believed to have been the starting destination for Polynesian migrations to Hawaii and New Zealand, and James Cook and Charles Darwin had both paid it a visit; like Maupiti, it wasn’t a popular or well-known destination in French Polynesia for tourists; and given its size (it’s the second largest island after Tahiti), there would be plenty to keep me busy.;;;;;;
Except this is a post about how I screwed up my time in Raiatea. I screwed up royally. Every decision I made when planning my trip to the island? They were uniformly poor.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
My Vision of Raiatea;;;;;;;;;
When I was initially researching my South Pacific trip, I added Raiatea to the itinerary for the reasons I mentioned above. And when it came to planning out what I’d do there, I opted for something a little different.;;;;;;;;;
While there are two tour companies on the island, offering full-day trips to the main sights, I decided to pass in order to have a less action-packed stay. I knew I’d be travelling quickly in French Polynesia, so I decided that Raiatea would be my rest stop.;;;;;;;;;
I found some accommodation that was close to several hiking trails, and decided that was how I’d spend my time. When I saw I’d have my own private swimming pool, I was sold.;;;;;;;;;
With three days on the island, I planned to spend one of those days hiking up a volcano to take photos of the lagoon, one of them sunbathing on a beach, and the other taking a day trip to nearby Tahaa island.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
            ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
Sadly, I ended up doing none of those activities. In fact, I did barely anything on Raiatea. Here’s how it all went wrong:;;;;;;;;;
I Didn’t Research Enough;;;;;;;;;
I’ll hold my hand up and confess that I can be a lazy traveller at times. Long-term travel has taught me that things will always work out in the end, so I’m never too worried about making plans. I researched Raiatea for an afternoon before deciding to visit, but that was a limit of my reading. There’s also the fact that there just isn’t all that much information about lesser-visited islands in French Polynesia online anyway.;;;;;;;;;
It wasn’t until I got to my accommodation that I realised it was almost impossible to get around the island without a car. While I can drive, I choose not to, because I’m a bad driver and don’t like putting my life at risk. I wasn’t aware that taxis would be hard to come by and that buses would be just as rare. I didn’t know that I was staying in an isolated part of the island without anything useful with a 5 kilometre radius. I didn’t even know until I arrived that the island didn’t have any beaches!;;;;;;;;;
What I should have done instead: Rather than assuming that everything would be great, I should have asked the owner of my Airbnb apartment any questions I had about the island — that’s what I did in the Maldives when I couldn’t find any information online. Did I need a car to see everything? What was within walking distance? How could I get to Tahaa from the apartment?;;;;;;;;;
If I’d have done so, I would have ended up staying in a much better location and had a much more enjoyable trip.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
  ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;
          ;;;;;;;;;

          ;;;;;;;;;
        ;;;;;;;;;
      ;;;;;;;;;
    ;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Chose the Wrong Type of Accommodation;;;;;;;;;
The Airbnb apartment I chose to stay in, Fare Nyimanu ($65/night), had nothing wrong with it. It was great in fact. The owners were sweet — they picked me up and dropped me off at the airport for free in their car, they took me to a local store to pick up some food for my stay, and they were always checking that everything was going well. The apartment was lovely, with a swimming pool overlooking Raiatea’s lagoon and easy access to hiking trails leading up the slopes of an extinct volcano.;;;;;;;;;
But it was also in the middle of nowhere and I felt stranded throughout my time there. There wasn’t a single store within walking distance of the apartment, unless you thought a 10+ km round trip to buy anything was walking distance, so I ended up trying to stretch my small bag of snacks I’d bought at the beginning for my entire trip. I was too far to get to the ferry terminal to visit Tahaa. I tried to hike from the apartment, but just ended up wading through waist-high grass in circles for an hour until I walked into a beehive. I know.;;;;;;;;;
In short: I was isolated, there wasn’t anywhere nearby to get food, I couldn’t find where the hike started from, and because it rained during my entire time there, I couldn’t even use the pool.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
What I should have done instead: Raiatea is a large island and there’s plenty of options for accommodation. I should have stayed at a hotel in the centre of the main town, Uturoa. Had I been there, I could have gone shopping for souvenirs on rainy days, easily arranged a trip to Tahaa island, and had easy access to good food. If I were to return, I’d opt to stay at Teavapiti Lodge or Hotel Raiatea Lodge instead.;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;
I Didn’t Take Into Account the Likelihood for Bad Weather;;;;;;;;;
I was in French Polynesia at the height of the cyclone and monsoon season. Just like in Maupiti, it therefore rained an awful lot in Raiatea. In fact, it rained every single day until my final afternoon on the island. Even if I had been staying in a better location, those hikes I’d planned to take, the sunbathing I’d planned to do, the lying beside the pool, and potentially the day spent exploring Tahaa would have still likely amounted to nothing. It was too rainy to step outside.;;;;;;;;;

What I should have done instead: While I was in the Cook Islands, it barely rained at all — many of the locals couldn’t stop talking about how dry the rainy season had been this year. I had naively thought it would be the same in French Polynesia.;;;;;;;;;
Rather than making assumptions, I should have taken into account that it was likely to rain and made alternative plans. Rather than planning for hiking and sunbathing, I should have booked a tour of the island as soon as I’d realised my trip was likely to be rained off.;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;
I Didn’t Stay for Long Enough;;;;;;;;;
A common theme of my French Polynesia trip was not slowing down enough to enjoy my surroundings. I was so excited by the possibilities that come from being surrounded by hundreds of islands that I wanted to get to as many as possible.;;;;;;;;;

By only giving myself three days to explore Raiatea, I screwed myself over when the weather gods were unkind to me. And, of course, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky on the day I left the island!;;;;;;;;;
What I should have done instead: I wish I’d opted to spend five days in Raiatea instead. Granted, I can’t control the weather and maybe it might have rained for five days if I’d done so, but it would have given me a bigger window for activities and I may have come away from Raiatea actually feeling like I’d seen some of it.;;;;;;;;;

So, Raiatea? Things didn’t go great between us. Some of that was my fault and some of it couldn’t be helped.;;;;;;;;;
So what should you do when you screw up your travel plans and nothing goes as you’d hoped?;;;;;;;;;
How to Make the Best Out of a Crap Travel Situation;;;;;;;;;
Practice self-care: It’s no secret that the past couple of years have been extremely tough on my mental health, and sadly, it’s a battle I’m still fighting. The one good thing to come out of my breakdown, though, is that I finally started taking time out of my day to care for myself — something I’ve never done before. I always told myself it was a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;
Even if you’re not a mess like me, travel can be incredibly stressful and hard on your body, so gaining an unexpected rest day can’t be a bad thing! Use that time to be creative, to read a book, to catch up on sleep, or to edit some of your photos.;;;;;;;;;

In Raiatea, I spent my time sitting on the sofa with the wide doors open, my Kindle Paperwhite in hand, devouring books that I’d have likely not got around to reading for several months if I hadn’t had this downtime. I used my beloved Headspace app to meditate in the mornings and evenings. I practiced my push ups and continued stretching in my seemingly infinite-lasting quest to do the splits, because exercise is so good for my mind.;;;;;;;;;
Keep your expectations low: One of the first lessons I learned when I started travelling was to keep my expectations in check. After having spent most of my life dreaming of various cities around the world, I found that once I finally got to visit them, my sky high expectations were rarely ever met. On the other hand, the places I spontaneously visited with no prior expectations were often the ones that impressed me most.;;;;;;;;;
One of the best things you can do is to keep your expectations low — that way, if things don’t go perfectly, you’re less likely to be disappointed.;;;;;;;;;
Don’t beat yourself up over it: It sucks when things don’t work out, and it’s normal to feel frustrated by it. When I travel, I can’t help but equate feeling disappointed by a destination with defeat; that I failed as a traveller because I didn’t get to see the best of a place. And what if I never return and never get the chance to see all the things I missed this time around? ;;;;;;;;
But if you did everything you could and couldn’t have changed anything, you have to let it go. You have to accept that not every single travel destination and experience is going to be perfect — I’m definitely proof of that! — and that’s okay.;;;;;;;;;
Make the most of your next destination: Draw a line in the sand and move on to your next destination without harbouring regrets. Instead, throw yourself into appreciating and enjoying your next stop even more than you would have done before. Make the effort to take tours you’d never have considered taking, sign up for classes, hire a bicycle, try something new.;;;;;;;;;
That’s exactly what I did in Huahine, the next stop on my French Polynesia journey.;;;;;;;;;
"Where was the last place you visited where nothing seemed to go right?""";;;;;;;;;
